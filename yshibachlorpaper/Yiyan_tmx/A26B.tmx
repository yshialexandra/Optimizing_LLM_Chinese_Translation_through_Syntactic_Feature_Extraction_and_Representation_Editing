</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Instead of taking to the stage in San Francisco to unveil the company's latest products – an event that has become something of a fixture in the technology industry - Jobs will be replaced by Phil Schiller, one of Apple's senior vice presidents.
</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>不像每年乔布斯登上San Francisco的舞台揭开苹果公司的最新产品的神秘面纱――这已经成为了业界的每年的固定节目――Phil Schiller，苹果的一个高级副主管，将取代乔布斯去完成今年的任务。
</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>No reasons for Jobs's withdrawal were given, but in a statement Apple said that it was making a long-term decision to reduce its activity at trade shows and conferences – adding that after 2009's event was over, the company would no longer hold any kind of keynote at Macworld.
</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>苹果官方对乔布斯的缺席没有给出任何原因，但有一种说法是减少苹果在贸易秀和会议中的活跃性是一个长期的决定――并且，在2009年的这次年度大会后，在苹果将不再有年度主题会议。
</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>"It will be Apple's last keynote at the show," said the statement. "Apple has been steadily scaling back on trade shows in recent years."  </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>“这将是苹果在最后一次年度大会上公布自己的主题，”一种说法是这样，“苹果这最近这些年正在稳定地减少在贸易秀中的规模。”
</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>However, the decision to drop Jobs in favour of one of his subordinates is cause for concern among those who follow the company closely, rekindling speculation about the health of the 53-year-old.
</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>不过，乔布斯缺席而他的副手代替的决定引起了那些关注他们公司的人对53岁的乔布斯健康问题的怀疑。

<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>“在商业领域，洞察力就是一切。</seg></tuv>

<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>So it's tantamount that Steve get up on stage and keep up the image. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>所以乔布斯在舞台上重新站起和他维持这种形象同样重要。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>

</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>苹果的年度大会仍然是一个重要的媒体事件，尤其是他的主题演讲。”他说。

</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>“我认为苹果本可以做很多是大众不对乔布斯的健康这么质疑。”他告诉一个联合的出版社。

</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>His gaunt appearance at June's Apple Worldwide Developers' Conference led to speculation that the cancer had returned, and while the company has previously denied such reports, it is believed his dramatic weight loss was linked to treatment he had been receiving while in remission.
</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>他在六月份苹果的全球开发商大会上憔悴的外表引起了人们对他癌症回来的怀疑，然而苹果否认这样的报道，人们相信他体重的急剧减少是由于他正接受的治疗。
</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>In October, Jobs tried to joke about the concerns over his health during a presentation to unveil new laptops when he put up a slide saying "110/70", saying that was his blood pressure - and that he would take no other questions on his health.
</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>在十月，乔布斯在一次展示新的笔记本电脑时开那些关于他健康的担心的玩笑，他滑了一下说“110/70”说这是他的血压，并说他对他的健康没有任何疑问。

</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>That seemed to put the rumours to rest, but the latest announcement will spark them again. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>这似乎使得谣言停息，不过最近的发言却将它们再次点燃。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Wall Street has been nervous about the company's ability to come through the economic downturn with the same growth, judging it to be highly reliant on the consumer side of the economy, which has been very weak in the US. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>华尔街怀疑苹果是否能在经济低迷中保持同样的增长率，考虑到苹果主要靠消费能力，而在美国现在十分虚弱。</seg></tuv>

<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>然而苹果有充足的现金可以移除任何财政坏账。
</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>What is less clear is how well it could weather a prolonged illness or absence of the man who is acknowledged to have breathed new life into it when he rejoined in 1996, and is now seen as its figurehead and driving force.
</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>不清晰的是苹果是否能挨过乔布斯的疾病或者说这样一个男人，在1996年重新加入苹果时被认为开始了他的新生活，并被视为是伟大领袖和驱动力，的缺席。
</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>The announcement meanwhile that Apple will not exhibit at future Macworld Expo shows almost certainly spells the death knell for the show - which will struggle to justify its existence without either Jobs or its principal supplier to draw crowds.
</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>同时，这次发言说在苹果未来的年度大会中不会再展示新产品敲响了年度大会的丧钟--这会证明没有了乔布斯或者说主要支持者来吸引观众它的存在是否还有意义。
</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>It may end up rolled into the Consumer Electronics Show, which runs at the same time - although in past years Jobs's presentations have damped CES's announcements so thoroughly that that show, held in Las Vegas, has shrunk in both size and impact.
</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>它可能被包括在消费电子秀中，在每年的同一时间举行，虽然在过去的那些年中，乔布斯的展览完全压倒了消费电子秀，致使在Las Vegas举行的它在规模和影响力方面缩减。  </seg></tuv>
