<seg>Anyone who has ever attempted pure scientific or philosophical thought knows how one can hold a problem momentarily in one's mind and apply all one's powers of concentration to piercing through it, and how it will dissolve and escape and you find that what you are surveying is a blank. </seg>

<seg>Then being a supreme mathematical technician he could dress it up, how you will, for purposes of exposition, but it was his intuition which was pre-eminently extraordinary - 'so happy in his conjectures', said De Morgan, 'as to seem to know more than he could possibly have any means of proving'. </seg>

<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>然后作为一个至高的数学技师，他能够像你们[译者注：听众，剑桥的教授和学生们]将做的那些，为了解释的目的将它装扮起来，但他的直觉才是真正卓越不平凡的地方——“在他的推测中如此幸福，”德摩根说，“以至于他知道的似乎比他所可能证明的要多。”</seg>

</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>'Yes,' replied Halley, 'but how do you know that? Have you proved it?' Newton was taken aback - 'Why, I've known it for years', he replied. 'If you'll give me a few days, I'll certainly find you a proof of it' - as in due course he did.
</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>“对啊！”哈雷说，“但你是怎样知道的呢？你证明过它吗？” 牛顿吃了一惊——“证明？为什么，我已知道它多年了，”他回答，“如果你给我几天时间，我肯定能给你找到它的一个证明”——如他所言，他及时地完成了。

<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Again, there is some evidence that Newton in preparing the Principia was held up almost to the last moment by lack of proof that you could treat a solid sphere as though all its mass was concentrated at the centre, and only hit on the proof a year before publication. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>同样，有证据表明牛顿一直在准备的《原理》推迟了很长时间，直到出版的一年前，他找到了能将一个实心球体看成是质量集中在其中心点的证明。</seg>

<seg>Why do I call him a magician? Because he looked on the whole universe and all that is in it as a riddle, as a secret which could be read by applying pure thought to certain evidence, certain mystic clues which God had laid about the world to allow a sort of philosopher's treasure hunt to the esoteric brotherhood. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>我为何称他为一个魔术师？因为他把整个宇宙以及所有宇宙内的事物都看作一个难解之谜，这个迷可以通过将纯粹思考运用于特定证据上来解读，就好像是上帝将这线索置于世界各处，以允许一类哲学家像财富探险者那样，最终探索着加入它那神秘的兄弟会一样。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>He believed that these clues were to be found partly in the evidence of the heavens and in the constitution of elements (and that is what gives the false suggestion of his being an experimental natural philosopher), but also partly in certain papers and traditions handed down by the brethren in an unbroken chain back to the original cryptic revelation in Babylonia. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>他相信，这些线索将被部分地发现于天空的证据中或元素的构成中（而这是一位自然实验哲学家的错误的设想），但也部分地存在于特定的文献和习俗中，这些文献和习俗可以追溯到在古巴比伦的最初的秘密启示，带着末被打开的铁链被兄弟们传下来。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>He regarded the universe as a cryptogram set by the Almighty - just as he himself wrapt the discovery of the calculus in a cryptogram when he communicated with Leibniz. </seg>

<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>And he believed that by the same powers of his introspective imagination he would read the riddle of the Godhead, the riddle of past and future events divinely fore-ordained, the riddle of the elements and their constitution from an original undifferentiated first matter, the riddle of health and of immortality. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>他相信，同样地通过他内省想象的力量，他还将解读神性之谜，神灵所语言的关于过去与未来事件之谜，元素及它们从一个原始的无差别的第一物质的构成之谜，健康与不朽之谜。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>All would be revealed to him if only he could persevere to the end, uninterrupted, by himself, no one coming into the room, reading, copying, testing-all by himself, no interruption for God's sake, no disclosure, no discordant breakings in or criticism, with fear and shrinking as he assailed these half-ordained, half-forbidden things, creeping back into the bosom of the Godhead as into his mother's womb. 'Voyaging through strange seas of thought alone', not as Charles Lamb 'a fellow who believed nothing unless it was as clear as the three sides of a triangle'.
</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>对他而言，一切都将被揭示，只要他能够坚持到底，不被自己打断。没有人进入房间，阅读、重复、检验——一切都由他自己进行，以上帝的名义而没有打岔，没有揭露，没有不速之客，也没有批评。当他猛击这些半命令、半禁止的事物时，他带着害怕或退缩，爬回神性的胸怀中去如同进入母亲的子宫中，“独自航穿奇怪的思想之海”，而不像查尔斯·莱姆——“一个不相信任何事物除非它像一个三角形的三条边那样清楚的家伙。”
