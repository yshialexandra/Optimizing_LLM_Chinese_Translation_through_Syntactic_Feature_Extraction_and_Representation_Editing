<seg>Hitler felt that he could not openly acknowledge the relationship because “I am married to the German people and their fate!” He certainly didn’t want any pressures or family obligations nor, in G?rtemaker’s opinion, to “make himself vulnerable in the private sphere.” </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
