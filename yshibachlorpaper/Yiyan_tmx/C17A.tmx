<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Ben Jonson: In and Out of Shakespeare’s Shadow  </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>莎士比亚光环下的本·琼森（Ben Jonson）
</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Writing a few decades after the deaths of the two greatest writers of the Elizabethan and Jacobean era, the poet and critic John Dryden came clean about his feelings toward both.
</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>伊丽莎白一世和詹姆斯一世时期最伟大的两位作家去世的几十年后，诗人兼评论家约翰·德莱顿（John Dryden）表达了自己对这两位作家的怀念之情。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>“I admire him,” he wrote of Ben Jonson, “but I love Shakespeare.”  </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>“我钦佩他”，他这样评价本·琼森，“但是我更喜爱莎士比亚”。
</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>If in the context of literary history admiration can be said to entail sustained academic interest, and love to consist of centuries of popularity among both scholars and laymen alike, Dryden seems to have spoken for posterity.
</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>如果以文学史为背景，那么我们可以认为，佩服包含着学者对某人的学术产生的浓厚兴趣，而喜爱则表现了某人的作品几个世纪以来，在学者和普通大众之间的普及和流行程度。可见德莱顿的这番话也算表达了后世人们的心声。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Jonson was the more celebrated and multifariously accomplished figure during his time and in the years immediately after his death in 1637, but his plays are produced relatively rarely today ― only “Volpone” and “The Alchemist” are widely known ― and his poetry is read more rarely still.
</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>琼森是一位多才多艺、颇有成就且比较著名的人物，他在生前和去世后（1637年）都得到了人们的认可。但是在当代，他的戏剧却很少被人们演绎——只有《狐坡尼》（Volpone）和《炼金术士》（The Alchemist）这两部作品被人们熟知，他的诗歌也不太被人们经常颂读。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Shakespeare has emerged as the great genius of the age, the author of plays that will hold the stage as long as there are stages to hold, and a cycle of sonnets that are almost equally prized.
</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>然而，伟大天才莎士比亚的“待遇”却和琼森大不相同：只要有舞台，他的作品就会在舞台上演，只要有人喜欢诗歌，他的十四行诗就会在人们的心中和口中吟诵。
</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>The contrasting lives ― and posthumous fates ― of Jonson and Shakespeare are a minor but recurring theme in the deeply researched but happily readable new biography of Jonson by Ian Donaldson, entitled “Ben Jonson: A Life.”
</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>琼森和莎士比亚迥异的生活和身后的命运并不太重要，但是却衍生出了作家伊恩·唐纳森（Ian Donaldson）对这个反复出现的主题的全新解读——研究深刻且愉快地易于阅读的《本·琼森传》（Ben Jonson: A Life）。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>A general editor of the forthcoming seven-volume “Cambridge Edition of the Works of Ben Jonson,” Donaldson has a case to make that, despite the Shakespearean eclipse, Jonson was as central to the development of the British theater as Shakespeare was ― in some ways perhaps more so, at least during the years in which their plays were first produced.
</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>作为即将出版的七卷《剑桥大学本·琼森作品选》的主编，唐纳森有理由认为，尽管在莎士比亚光环的笼罩下，琼森和莎士比亚一样，都是英国戏剧发展、壮大的中心人物，甚至在某些方面的贡献更大，至少在他们的第一部作品诞生的早些年是这样。
</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Jonson “would do much to transform the status of the dramatic author in early modern England, boldly asserting his moral dignity, critical authority and quasi-legal rights of textual ownership,” Donaldson writes.
</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>琼森“改变了早期英格兰戏剧作家的社会地位，大胆地宣称戏剧作家也拥人格尊严，也具有高尚情操，也是一位严肃的作家，同时他还向人们灌输，其文字作品也享有版权并受到准法律的保护，” 唐纳森这样写道。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>“Above all, he would make the dramatic author avisible figure ― nominally visible on the title pages of his works, imaginatively visible through the language of his own dramatic creations.”  </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>“尤其重要的是，琼森使戏剧作家这个头衔光明正大地出现在大众面前——戏剧作家的名字可以名正严顺地印刷在其作品的扉页上，他们的形象也因他们的戏剧作品会出现在人们的脑海中。”
</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Shakespeare’s comparative invisibility during his lifetime has certainly posed intractable problems in the centuries since his death, as the eternal and tedious arguments over the authorship of his plays illustrate.
</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>莎士比亚相对琼森来说过着“隐士”一样的生活，几个世纪以来，他的一生给人们留下了许多未解之谜，其中莎士比亚的真实作者身份，虽是老生长谈，但仍是人们争论不休的问题。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Had he the foresight to make himself the colorful and combative public figure Jonson was ― jailed several times, famed for insobriety, sometime friend and sometime foe of the mighty names of his age ― we would not be plagued by the rankling theories of the Oxfordians that still clamor today.
</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>如果莎翁真的具有前瞻性，他也会使自己成为像琼森那样富有传奇色彩的公众人物——好斗、几次入狱、传闻经常宿醉不醒、和那个时代的名人时好时坏，那么我们现在的后人也无需烦恼至今让人耿耿于怀的牛津郡理论——莎士比亚其实是牛津第十七世伯爵爱德华·德·维尔（Edward de Vere）。
</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>After a prologue that seems to protest a little much in insisting, contrary to general belief, that the Jonson biographer faces many of the same “puzzles and excitements” that challenge writers on Shakespeare, Donaldson begins his book midstride, almost literally, with Jonson marching out of London on a journey to Scotland undertaken entirely on foot.
</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>在这部琼森传记中，作者唐纳森一翻旁白过后，似乎更愿意坚称和人们不太一样的想法，他认为撰写琼森传记同样要面临着有关传主的“无人能解的迷思和令人兴奋的惊奇发现”，这和莎士比亚传记作者的感觉其实一样。然后唐纳森开篇跃然纸上的即是琼森从英兰到苏格兰一趟肩负责任的全程徒步旅行。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>It was 1618 and he was 46, and already a literary figure of sufficient renown that “along the road, local dignitaries, emissaries from the great houses, young people and old turn out to welcome him.”  </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>1618年琼森46岁，他当时已经很有名气，“在旅途中当地的高官、显贵、青年或老年人都对他礼遇有加。” </seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Although much work and greater fame were still ahead of him, Jonson “had already emerged as Britain’s first literary celebrity.”  </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>尽管琼森还有很多作品没有问世，而且他的名气在以后文学道路上还将进一步提升，但是在那时，琼森“已经成为英格兰文学界第一名人。”
</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>The Scottish journey was also notable for Jonson’s climactic meeting with William Drummond, whose jottings from the conversations they had have been a key resource for scholars, but in some ways a dubious and misleading one, as Donaldson convincingly argues.
</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>琼森著名的苏格兰之旅同样引人注意的是他和诗人威廉·杜拉蒙德（William Drummond）的“高峰会面”。两人的谈话记录对于琼森的研究学者来说非常有价值，但是作者唐纳森也坚信这些资料同样令人半信半疑，而且还会被它们误导。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>It is from these sketchy notes, for instance, that the image of Jonson as perhaps the first trash talker of literary London ?emerges, in his assessment that John Donne, the great poet and Jonson’s exact contemporary and friend, “deserved hanging” for “not keeping of accent.”
More infamous: the imputation that Shakespeare “wanted art.”  </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>例如从这些文献当中，我们更可能认为琼森是伦敦文学界出现的“八卦”学者第一人，他这样评价同时代的诗人兼他的好朋友约翰·多恩（John Donne），“他的诗歌韵律不统一，完全可以受到绞刑的惩罚”，更有甚者传言，他认为“莎士比亚的戏剧缺乏艺术性”。
</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Certainly Jonson was better read than Shakespeare, despite sharing relatively humble beginnings.
</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>尽管琼森出生身卑微，但是他受教育程度和学识都比莎士比亚要好。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>He was of Scottish descent ― hence the road trip ― and his birth is a matter of some conjecture, although the year was probably 1572.
(Donaldson spends too long sifting the matter of an exact date in the summer, in an ample digression on astrology.)
</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>琼森父辈是苏格兰人（所以才有了那次寻根之旅），他的出生日期也不太清楚，大约是1527年（作者唐纳森在书中花了不少篇幅详查在夏天出生的琼森的准确诞辰日期，他还在书中闲谈了大量星相学问题）。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>His father had died a month before his birth, and Jonson grew up in London as the stepson of a bricklayer, and would practice the trade himself, even after he began writing.
</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>琼森的父亲在他出生前一个月去世，然后琼森成了泥瓦匠的继子并在伦敦城里长大。后来琼森也做了泥瓦匠，虽然这时他已经开始了写作事业。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>But his intelligence won him a place at a good school, and he was well versed in Latin, drawing on classical authors (he particularly revered Horace) as models throughout his career.
</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>但是聪慧的琼森获得了一个在顶尖学校接受教育的机会，他精通拉丁文，从古典文学涉取营养，古典文学先贤作家是他一生学习的楷模，他最尊敬古罗马诗人贺拉斯。
</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>His theatrical beginnings came in early collaborations Jonson later disdained and excluded from the First Folio edition of his works, printed in 1616.
</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>琼森戏剧作家生涯开始不久后就和其他作家合著过一些戏剧作品，但是这些作品被人们轻视，没能收录在1616年出版的对开版琼森文集当中。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>One of them, the lost play “The Isle of Dogs,” occasioned his first stint in the clink, for sedition.
</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>其中的一部作品《The Isle of Dogs》[1]被认为具有煽动性言论，从而令他锒铛入狱一段时间，这也是他的第一次牢狱之灾（后来他还多次入狱）。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Satire, which would become a Jonson specialty as it never was for Shakespeare, was dangerous business in Elizabethan England.
</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>讽刺戏剧是琼森最擅长的剧种（莎士比亚从未写过此类戏剧），但是在伊丽莎白一世时期的英格兰，讽刺剧作家又是个很危险的职业。  </seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Jacobean England, too: Jonson would also write afoul of the Crown during James’s reign, when he was again imprisoned, along with his collaborators on the play “Eastward Ho!”  </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>詹姆斯一世时期的英格兰情况同样如此：琼森在这个时期也写过一些有关皇权交替、王室成员互相倾轧的故事，这一次琼森和另一位作者因为合著《Eastward Ho!》被一同关进监狱。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Donaldson notes that the surviving text gives little indication of what particularly offended the monarch, unless it was general ribbing of the Scottish knights who now peopled the court.
</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>唐纳森阅读了幸存下来的文字后认为，这部作品并没有什么特别的内容表达对皇室的藐视，只不过是有些地方嘲笑了在宫庭中有一定地位的苏格兰的达官显贵们。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Kings and queens are notoriously touchy.
</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>大家都知道国王和女王都是非常敏感的。
</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Despite these somewhat puzzling missteps, given his ambition and proximity to the centers of power, throughout his life Jonson made significant headway among the treacherous waters of the English court, a remarkable feat given the many strikes against him.
</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>尽管琼森犯过很多错误，至今这些不适当言行还是一个谜团，但是他的雄心壮志，他能够在阴险多诈的英国宫庭接近当时的权力中心，并且能克服各种困难，这就证明琼森的整个职业生涯还是相当出色且进步极快。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>“He was a difficult, quarrelsome, vain, pedantically learned, hard-drinking member of the wrong faith, tainted with a criminal record,” Donaldson writes, as well as “a satirist of court manners” accused of sedition.
</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>“琼森执拗、好争斗、虚荣、有学问、喜欢酗酒、是个异教徒，而且还有犯罪记录，” 唐纳森这样写道，同时他“还是宫庭礼教的讥讽者”，经常被指控犯有煽动罪。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>For all that, he became one of the most sought-after authors of masques, the elaborate entertainments combining poetry, music and dancing that were commissioned by the king and queen and various deep---pocketed aristocrats for special occasions and holidays.
</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>不管怎样，最后他还是成为了最受欢迎的策划化妆舞会的戏剧作家，精致的文娱节目加上优美的诗歌、音乐和舞蹈，所有这些都令国王、女王和贵族们争相委托琼森在特别时刻或假期为他们创办一台舞会。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>He was forgiven much for his talent.
</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>可以说琼森的才华最终使他避过不少灾祸。
</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Jonson married many contradictions (and a wife, of whom little is known and who plays virtually no role in this biography), and Donaldson delves into them all thoroughly.
</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>琼森的一生有着很多不解之谜（这也包括他的妻子，很少有人知道他的妻子是谁，在这部琼森传记中也不曾提到他的妻子），作者唐纳森都对这些谜题仔细研究努力寻找到答案。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>He draws at length on recent scholarship, mostly for minor points, and is generous ― perhaps overly so ― in crediting other Jonson specialists. ?</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>最后他会引用很多专家的研究成果（都是一些细小问题），并且非常慷慨地提到了这些专家的名字</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>(Phrases like “Barbara Mowat has persuasively argued” and “Fredson Bowers has plausibly suggested” recur with numbing frequency, even though the book includes generous endnotes.)
</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>（例如“芭芭拉·莫沃特坚信”或“费德森·伯沃斯可能认为”等这类词语出现的非常多，虽然传记尾页包含了大量的注释。）
</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Because its subject is ever evolving ― “Jonson, like his own creation, Volpone, moved with the agility of a player from one role to the next,” as Donaldson puts it ― the book moves at a lively clip, despite the occasional excessive divagation into the byways of court politics and the troublesome matter of religion, which remained a volatile topic throughout Jonson’s life.
</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>随着主题的推进——“琼森的一生就像他创造的人物狐坡尼，会轻巧地从一个角色跳跃到另一个角色，” 作者唐纳森在书中写道—— 整部传记的各章节生动、精悍，尽管偶尔地大篇幅讲述不太重要的宫庭政治和给人带来麻烦的宗教问题。我们谈论这些话题，全因琼森风云变幻的整个生命都受到这些外部因素的影响。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>(After converting to Catholicism during Elizabeth’s reign ― and being brought to court for recusancy, along with his wife ― Jonson returned to the Anglican fold later in life; on neither occasion does political expediency appear to have played any role.)
</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>（在伊丽莎白时期，琼森改投天主教后就和他的妻子被带到法庭受审，他在晚年又皈依了英国国教。政治上的权宜之讲似乎并没有为他带来任何好处。）
</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Donaldson’s analysis of Jonson’s writings is necessarily condensed, given the sheer mass of words produced, but he makes incisive arguments for the great comedies of contemporary London life, and gives almost equal due to the now all-but-unknown historical dramas, “Sejanus His Fall” and “Catiline His Conspiracy.”
</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>考虑到文学作品需要大量的文字分析，作者唐纳森对琼森文学作品的分析当然要简明扼要，但是他却透彻地分析了反应琼森时代伦敦生活的优秀戏剧作品，同时他也分析了人们不太熟知的两部历史剧《Sejanus His Fall》和《Catiline His Conspiracy》。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>There are also generous selections from his poetry ― much of it written to praise patrons ― and descriptions of the masques on which he collaborated (and quarreled) with the architect and designer Inigo Jones.
</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>作者唐纳森还摘选了不少琼森的诗歌作品，这些诗作大都是歌颂他的保护人，或者描绘举办盛大化妆舞会时的场景（在舞会上琼森的合作者是舞台背景兼服装设计师伊尼戈·琼，他还经常和设计师吵架）。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Jonson’s writing contains a measure of quotable lines ― “Drink to me only with thine eyes” is his ― but because his sharpest gift was for savage satire, his plays lack the universal appeal of even Shakespeare’s slightest comedies.
</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>琼森的作品包含许多至今被人们引用的隽语，例如“请你只有眼睛为我祝酒（Drink to me only with thine eyes）”就是琼森的名作佳句。但是琼森更擅长创作尖酸的用来讥讽世人的讽刺作品，所以他的作品和莎翁相比缺少清新、洒脱的风格</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>(T. S. Eliot, an admirer of Jonson’s, wrote that his was “an art of caricature,” albeit “of great caricature, like Marlowe’s.”)
</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>（琼森的仰慕者艾略特曾写道，琼森是“讽刺艺术的大师并可以和马洛[3]相媲美”）。
</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>His writings for the theater, Jonson once grumbled, gained him less than ?200 in the course of his life.
</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>琼森曾经抱怨为剧院创作剧本收入微薄，他的一生从剧院赚来的钱区区不到200英傍。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>He was often reduced to penury, and the humiliation of calling on his muses to plea for money in verse.
</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>他经常穷困潦倒，他谦卑屈就，只能依靠他的缪斯女神赋予他创作灵感，令他的诗歌能给他带来稍许金钱。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>But while it was not a lucrative pursuit, he believed ardently in the importance of publishing his work, and was also instrumental in helping to usher Shakespeare’s First Folio into being.
</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>他坚信把自已的作品出版成集非常重要，虽然这并不能给他带来多少收入，他的创举为莎士比亚出版他的第一部对开版作品奠定了道路。
</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>His verses of praise published in the Folio end with a celebrated encomium: “He was not of an age, but for all time!”  </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>琼森出版的对开版赞美诗集为他赢得溢美之词：“他不属于那个时代，他属于整个时代！” </seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>History has borne out the truth of this exclamation, obviously, but there is a brittle irony in the subsequent decline in repute of its author.
</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>历史证明了人们对他的赞美并非虚言，但是后来琼森的名气渐渐变小，这不得不说是一个尴尬的讽刺。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Jonson sought assiduously to play a great role on the public stage of his time, as a playwright, poet and general figure of literary renown, and he hoped that posterity would bring even greater glory.
</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>作为戏剧作家、诗人、著名的文人，琼森一直努力在他的时代寻找自已的一席之地，并希望子孙后代能加予他更多的荣耀。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>But by the 18th century it was Shakespeare whose imaginative works captivated the English-speaking world.
</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>但是从十八世纪开始，英语世界的人心被莎士比亚的虚构作品所捕获。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>As Donaldson wryly says, “Fame, whose uncertainty Jonson had always recognized, had proved to be an erratic friend.”  </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>就如琼森传记作者唐纳森挖苦地说道：“名望——琼森生时已经认识了它的三心二意，最后证实它的确是一位飘忽不定的朋友。”</seg></tuv>
