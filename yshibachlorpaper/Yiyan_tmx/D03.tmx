<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>As we've already noted, the religion created in Babylon by Nimrod and Semiramis is known as the Mystery Religion or simply The Mysteries. At its core, it was an inverted re-telling of the fall of man in Genesis.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>我们已经知晓，宁录与塞米勒米斯在巴比伦所创立的宗教是秘密宗教，或者秘术，其核心是创世纪人类堕落的扭曲版本。</seg>

<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>In the Biblical account of the incident, the serpent caused Adam and Eve to sin against God by suggesting they eat the fruit from the tree of knowledge. Because they acted in disobedience to God who had specifically told them not to eat from that tree, sin entered into the human race and all the misery, disease and tragedy that makes up human history stems from that moment.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>圣经中，蛇劝亚当和夏娃吃分别善恶树的果子、人类犯罪离开上帝，因为上帝曾特别地叮嘱他们不能吃分别善恶树上的果子，而他们没有听从，罪于是进入了人类，那一刻凄惨、疾病、悲剧在人类历史里生根发芽。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>

<seg>In the Babylonian inversion of this event however, the serpent is portrayed as the real good god. He was worshipped for opening the eyes of men and for infusing the woman with his passion and lust. </seg>

<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>巴比伦版本的创世纪里，蛇被描述为正义的神祗，并因打开了男人的眼睛、将激情和欲望放入女人的身体而被膜拜。</seg>

<seg>He was seen as a liberator and an enlightener. To them, he illuminated the minds of mankind by revealing to them the secret knowledge that God had tried to keep from them. </seg>

<seg>That is why the religion is called the Mysteries - Because it claims to harbour this secret knowledge that was offered to Adam and Even in the Garden of Eden. </seg>

<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>这就是这样的宗教叫做“秘密宗教”——因为它声称将神秘的知识给了伊甸园的那两个人。</seg>

<seg>Because Nimrod and Semiramis set themselves up as the sun and moon gods, the religion also made use of a corruption of primeval astronomy. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>因为宁录和塞米勒米斯将他们自己设立为太阳神和月神，所以巴比伦的秘密宗教就使用早期天文学的堕落形式、为己所用。</seg>

<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>It was believed by Noah's righteous ancestors that the stars told the story of Satan's rebellion against God in heaven, his fall, subversion of mankind, the promise of a Messiah who would suffer and die to lift the curse of sin and then be installed as Lord of creation and conqueror of Satan. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>挪亚公义敬虔的祖先确信，撒旦的反叛、人类的瓦解、未来弥赛亚的应许（受苦并死亡、除去罪的咒诅）、上帝的创造被重整、撒旦被征服的一系列，都通过天空的星象系统显现出来。</seg>

<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Semiramis however, again inverted the story and so in the Mysteries the stars of the sky told a different story. In the Babylonian version, Satan was depicted as the rightful lord of the universe, whose throne has only been temporarily usurped by God. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>但是塞米勒米斯将这个故事颠覆了，在巴比伦版本的秘密宗教，天上的星象讲述了一个另外的故事：撒旦是宇宙公义的君王，他的宝座仅是被上帝暂时篡取了。</seg>

<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>One day an anti-Christ, a seed of the serpent, would be born of a divine mother, would become god himself, replace God and return rulership of the world to the serpent. </seg>

<seg>If the stars told the stories of things that had passed they could also tell the stories of things to come. </seg>

<seg>They would therefore divide the sky into sections and give meanings to each section on the basis of the stars that are found there. </seg>

<seg>In times to come, astrology would pass to the empire of ancient Egypt, which is the location we most associate with pyramids today. </seg>

<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>后来，这种占星术又被传到古埃及帝国，也就是现今有金字塔的地区，那里，所有的“圣山”。</seg>

<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>The 'sacred mountain' pyramids were constructed with certain mathematical relationships to the stars.</seg>

<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>金字塔都是依据占星术、精密计算后建造的。</seg>

<seg>By the time Moses led the Jews out of Egypt in Exodus, astrology had also infected the population in Canaan which was the land that they were headed towards. </seg>

<seg>Hence, some of the strictest warnings in the Bible against astrology date from this period (Lev. 19:31; Deut. 18).</seg>

<seg>因此旧约圣经里，上帝多次严厉地警告以色列人不要参与占星术。</seg>

<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>The Biblical denunciations of astrology identify the practice with demonism or Satanism in the sense that Satan and his hosts were actually being worshiped in the guise of the signs, planets and stars. And as mentioned previously, the leading lights of the sky - sun and moon - were worshipped in the form of Nimrod and Semiramis.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>圣经里谴责占星术，是因为撒旦化身为（占星术的）这些符号、行星、恒星获得人类的敬拜；前文我们也提到过，天空的两个主要光源---太阳和月亮，也以宁录和塞米勒米斯的名号被敬拜。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Very significantly, a third leading light was identified in the sky that was 23 times more luminous than the sun and therefore was considered to be the most important star in the sky. It is known as the "dog star", "Sirius", or "The morning star" because it is still visible even in the morning light. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>很重要的是，天空中第三亮的星星实际上比太阳亮23倍（只是距离地球很遥远），因此可以算是天空中最重要的星星；它也被称作天狼星或者“早晨之星”，因可以在早上被看见。</seg>

<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Remember in Isaiah 14:12 Lucifer is referred to as the morning star. </seg>

<seg>This kind of system that needs to keep knowledge concealed from the masses, by its very nature, necessitates the use of symbolism, gestures, monuments, secret words and signs to ensure that those in the dark are kept in the dark.

By using symbols, information can be communicated by being 'hidden in plain sight'.
