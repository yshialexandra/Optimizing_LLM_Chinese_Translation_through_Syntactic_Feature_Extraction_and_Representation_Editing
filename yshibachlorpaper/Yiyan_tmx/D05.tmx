<seg>基督教进入了这个巴比伦宗教的中心城市，罗马凯撒是这个巴比伦宗教的最高祭司。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Not an easy beginning. The people of Rome were thoroughly indoctrinated with the habits, superstitions and traditions that had originated with Nimrod and Semiramis. </seg>

<seg>To be honest it was a cesspit. Therefore it should come as no surprise to learn that Christians were bitterly persecuted by the Romans, who tolerated everyone except those who believed in Jesus.</seg>

<seg>The claim that particularly infuriated Roman Emperors was that Jesus was "the way, the truth and the life" and that "no one comes to the Father except by me." (John 4:16). </seg>

<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>最激怒罗马凯撒的事情是，耶稣是 “道路,真理,生命，只有通过耶稣才能到上帝那里去”。—— &lt;约翰福音&gt;4章</seg>

<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>This was a direct challenge to their position as gods. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>这个宣告直接挑战了凯撒作为一位神祗的权威。 </seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>The consequent brutality of the Roman Empire towards Christians has gone down in infamy. Once captured, Christians were thrown to lions for sport in coliseums while the baying crowd watched them being torn limb from limb. They were dipped in oil and then set alight at the side of the roads to become living human torches. Another method of execution was being sewn into animal skins and then led to die at the fangs and claws of wild animals. Some were noted to have had crowns of metal nailed into their heads. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>凯撒对基督徒充满敌意，将他们丢到斗兽场里、众目睽睽之下他们被狮子撕碎，泼油在他们身上引燃做“路灯”，将他们缝到动物皮里被野兽的牙齿和爪子弄死，将金属头冠的钉子钉进他们脑袋，不一而足。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>The book of Hebrews in the Bible reports that some were placed inside a hollowed out tree and then sawn in half. </seg>

<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>These things illustrate the viciousness of Satan's hatred and retaliation towards God's people. Never underestimate just how much Satan despises a follower of God or what he would do to us if he was in a position of power. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>这些酷刑体现撒旦的邪恶，不要低估掌权执政的撒旦对上帝子民的憎恨程度，也不要高估他对上帝追随者的行为下限。</seg>
</tuv>

<seg>Remember the golden rule - manipulation and deception while in a position of weakness; intimidation and violence while in a position of power. </seg>

<seg>记住以下金律：撒旦为掌握支配权，弱势时操纵欺骗，强势时使用暴力和威胁。</seg>

<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>And when Satan eventually has his way on this Earth at the end of the age and reaches a position of power, the Bible tells us that there will be a Great Tribulation that the world has never seen before or will ever see again.</seg>

</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>It wasn't until Emperor Constantine, who signed the Edict of Milan in 312AD that allowed for the tolerance of Christianity, that the persecution really came to an end. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>公元312年，君士坦丁大帝签署了&lt;米兰敕令&gt;（Edict of Milan），决定对基督徒保持宽容，所有的迫害停止了。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Now the world at large traditionally sees this as the best thing that could have ever happened to Christianity but I'm going to suggest it wasn't. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>传统的认识是，这是个好消息，但我不这么认为。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>You see, while many believe this was the pivotal moment in Christian history that allowed it to settle, grow and become the largest religion in the world, the evidence suggests that firstly, Constantine only legalised Christianity for political reasons and that his own supposed conversion wasn't truly sincere. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>基督信仰固然在罗马安营扎寨以后、逐步发展成为世界上最大的宗教，但有证据证实：第一，君士坦丁出于政治考虑，从法律上承认基督教，但他并不真诚。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>For example, there is evidence to show that Constantine still retained many elements of sun worship even after his supposed conversion and there have been reports of secret Vatican files that prove he kept his allegiance to the sun god. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>例如，梵蒂冈的解密文件显示，君士坦丁在敬拜中，保留了不少太阳崇拜的成分、并敬拜太阳神。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Coins carrying his image from this period continued to portray him as "Soli Invicto Comit" which means "Colleague of the Invincible Sun." </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>罗马银币上，他的头像被刻画为“无可匹敌的太阳的同伴”（Soli Invicto Comit）</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Constantine's personal life also reflected the theory that he hadn't ever truly converted to Christianity or understood its message. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>第二，君士坦丁的个人生活并未反映他已改宗。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>He became a cruel and dissolute monarch, whose cruelty extended to members of his own family. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>他是残暴、堕落的君王，并且对家人也较凶暴。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>He was also clearly corrupted by his fortune. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>掌握了巨大的财富的他，生活腐朽。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>If we judge the tree by its fruits we would reasonably conclude that he remained untouched by the love of Christ until the end.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>若把君士坦丁比喻成一棵树，那么从他“所结的果子”来看，即使到生命的最后时刻，他仍未被上帝的爱所触摸。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>The truth is that there was such uproar and division in the Roman Empire at the time that its unity was beginning to be threatened. If the unity of Rome was threatened, so was Constantine's grip on power. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>事实上，罗马帝国当时正面临骚乱和 分裂的威胁，君士坦丁的权力也面临考验。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Constantine basically appealed to the vanity and pride of the bishops of the time. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>君士坦丁被宗教首脑的身份吸引。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>He went on a charm offensive and bestowed a number of favours on the church. Instead of martyring bishops, he began to treat them as his political aides and gave them a say in the Empire's political affairs. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>在给教会许多恩惠后，他获得了宗教首脑的身份，他将基督教会视为政治上的帮助、并把帝国的部分世俗事务交给教会管理。</seg>

<seg>The High Priest </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>最高祭司</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>One of the main reasons we should suspect Constantine never truly converted was that he failed to relinquish his inherited title of Supreme Pontiff or High Priests that had first been assumed by Julius Caesar. Constantine therefore remained the official earthly head of the Mysteries throughout his life. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>君士坦丁未改宗的另一个显著证据是，他并未放弃尤利西斯-凯撒以降、历代凯撒所持有的宗教最高主教（Pontiff）的身份，君士坦丁终其一生是巴比伦秘密宗教在地上的首脑。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>It wasn't until 376 AD that the young Emperor Gratian became the first to refuse the position of Supreme Pontiff, considering it inconsistent with faith in Christ. In addition he also legally abolished paganism in the Empire, although this abolition didn't extend to the city of Rome itself, where it was still rampant. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>直到公元376年，年轻的凯撒格拉提安(Gratian,367年 - 383年共治皇帝)才成为拒绝接受最高祭司身份的第一人，格拉提安认为这样做无法与基督信仰相协调，并从法律层面剥离了对假神的敬拜，虽然这个决定并未扩展到整个罗马城——城内依然充斥着迷信。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Rome at this time was colloquially referred to as "the sink of all superstitions."</seg>
</tuv>

<seg>这段时期被称作罗马帝国之“所有迷信的败落（The sink of all superstitions）”。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>After Gratian refused the office of Supreme Pontiff or High Priest it became vacant once more and the links in the chain that had gone back to Nimrod were broken - but only for two years. It was soon reinstated to Damascus, the then Bishop of Rome, who had gained the position after much fighting and bloodshed with rivals. This position of Supreme Pontiff has been held by the Bishop of Rome ever since. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>最高祭司的职位再次被空缺出来，从宁录开始的隐秘灵界联系被打断了——但只维持了2年，主教大马士革（Damascus）又将一切恢复，血腥的斗争之后他成为了罗马帝国主教，该身份至今一直被罗马帝国主教垄断。</seg>

<seg>Paganism had not vanished. At the beginning of the 5th Century it had simply been absorbed into the Roman Catholic church which now contained all manner of superstitious rites and ceremonies inherited from Babylon.

<seg>In autumn there was a harvest festival that honoured the goddess Pamona and this became 'Christianised' as All Souls Day with All Saints Day coming on the 1st of November to again honour the Saints. It is better known today as Halloween; the night where evil is celebrated most overtly. </seg>

<seg>秋季里的11月1日，是崇拜Pamona女神的收成节，在“基督化”的方程公式里，这变成了圣徒节（All Saints Day，All Souls Day），为要敬拜圣徒；这么说吧，11月1日其实就是今日的万圣节（Halloween），这一天是邪灵的狂欢。</seg>

<seg>Also, Halloween should always be completely off the agenda for a Christian. It remains from all possible angles nothing but a celebration of evil, witchcraft, sorcery, darkness, divination, occult activities and demons. </seg>

<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>另外，基督徒的日历里应该把万圣节划掉，那一天不会出现任何天使，只有邪恶、巫术、占星术、黑暗权势、占卜、秘术和魔鬼。</seg>

<seg>With regards to other holidays and days of worship the best advice I can give is from the Bible: "And whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him." </seg>

<seg>关于节日，我的建议是：“无论做什么，言语和行为，都奉耶稣的名，将感谢献给父神“，这来自圣经。”</seg>
