<seg>A few days after getting the news, my sister Amy drove to Somerville with a friend and collected two boxes of things from Tiffany's room: family photographs, many of which had been ripped into pieces, comment cards from a neighborhood grocery store, notebooks, receipts. </seg>

<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">

<seg>Amy snapped some pictures while she was there, and, individually and in groups, those of us left studied them for clues: a paper plate on a dresser that had several drawers missing, a phone number written on a wall, a collection of mop handles, each one a different color, arranged like cattails in a barrel painted green.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>艾美给她的房间拍了些照片，我们留存了下来，独自或几个人一起从里面找线索：不见了几个抽屉的碗柜里放着一个纸盘子，墙上写了一排电话号码，一捆拖把柄，柄柄颜色都不一样，看起来像插在绿桶里的一把香蒲。</seg>
