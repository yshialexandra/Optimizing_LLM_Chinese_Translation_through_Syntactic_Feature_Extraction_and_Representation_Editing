</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">

<seg>This job was a common one for young boys in the agriculturally rich Unity State of what is now South Sudan; little Peter was probably about 3 years old, but he had been going to the cattle camps for most of his short life – riding on his father's shoulders, or carried by an older brother who would plop him down on the grass if it was time to wrestle or play with the other kids.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>这对一个住在农业发达的联合州的男孩子来讲是再普通不过的活计；小彼得当时可能只有3岁，但大部分时间也要呆在畜栏——骑在父亲的肩头，或者哥哥领着他，如果哥哥要和别的小伙伴摔跤或玩耍，便可能会把他扑通一下扔到草地上。</seg>
