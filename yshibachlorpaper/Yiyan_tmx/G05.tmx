<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Barak wanted peace with Lebanon, too, because he had committed to withdrawing Israeli forces from the country by the end of the year, and a peace agreement would make Israel safer from Hezbollah attacks along the border, and would not make it appear that Israel had withdrawn because of the attacks. </seg>

<seg>However, a few weeks after that, when Madeleine Albright and Dennis Ross went to see Assad and Shara, who seemed completely recovered, Assad told them that he wanted to resume negotiations and was ready to make peace because he believed Barak was serious. </seg>

<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">

<seg>The Washington talks got off to a bit of a rocky start with an aggressive public statement by Shara. Nevertheless, in the private talks, when Shara suggested that we should start where the talks had left off in 1996, with Rabin's pocket commitment of the June 4 line provided Israel's needs were met, Barak responded that while he had made no commitment on territory, we do not erase history. </seg>
