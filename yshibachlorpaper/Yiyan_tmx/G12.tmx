<seg>Nonetheless, more than any other single being, he helped during that decade to secure a conciliatory and mostly peaceful end to apartheid, one of the great abominations of the age, and an infinitely more hopeful start to a democratic South Africa than even the most quixotic could have imagined 20 years earlier.</seg>

<seg>When every pop star is "awesome", reality television makes idols out of oafs and "iconic" is so freely applied that it has become meaningless, it would be absurd not to see in the lionisation of Mr Mandela some of the veneration that came to attend Princess Diana: the world needs heroes, or heroines, and will not always choose them wisely. </seg>

<seg>In the 1950s he would often argue for restraint against more headstrong colleagues, and throughout most of his life he fought to keep his movement, the African National Congress (ANC), non-racial, though at times he had reservations about Indians and much stronger feelings about whites. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">

<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>When he did come round to guerrilla warfare, it was partly because he concluded that the government's increasing repression left no other way to bring about change ("The attacks of the wild beast cannot be averted with only bare hands"), partly because he feared that the ANC would lose out to more militant rivals, notably the exclusively black Pan Africanist Congress.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>后来他转为游击战时，部分是因为他认为政府的镇压越来越强烈，已经别无选择（“赤手空拳无法抵挡野兽的袭击”）；部分是因为他担心非国大会败给更好斗的对手，尤其是全黑的泛非主义者大会。</seg>

<seg>Moreover, he was consistent both in the 1950s, when the ANC was debating its objectives, and 20 years later, when the aims of the "liberation movement" were under discussion, in holding that the movement's great statement of principles, the Freedom Charter adopted in 1956, was not a commitment to socialism but "a step towards bourgeois democracy".</seg>

<seg>此外，他的立场前后一致，不论是1950年代非国大在讨论斗争目标时，还是20年后讨论“解放运动”的目的时，他都坚持认为运动的伟大纲领，1956年通过的《自由宪章》，并非是要走向社会主义，而是“资产阶级民主再前进一步”。</seg>
