<seg>William Alexander Morgan being applauded by Fidel Castro, in Havana in 1959. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>1959年，哈瓦那，威廉亚历山大摩根得到费德罗卡斯特罗的欢迎。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Morgan said that he had joined the Cuban Revolution because "the most important thing for free men to do is to protect the freedom of others."</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>摩根说，他参加古巴革命的原因是“对于一个自由人来说，最伟大的事就是捍卫他人的自由。”</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>For a moment, he was obscured by the Havana night. It was as if he were invisible, as he had been before coming to Cuba, in the midst of revolution. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>他一度隐身于哈瓦那的夜晚，默默无闻，即如他来到正处在革命浪潮中的古巴之前那样。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Then a burst of floodlights illuminated him: William Alexander Morgan, the great Yankeecomandante. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>然后在顷刻间，强光灯打在他的身上：威廉亚历山大摩根，这位伟大的美国佬指挥官成为世人关注的焦点。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>He was standing, with his back against a bullet-pocked wall, in an empty moat surrounding La Caba?a--an eighteenth-century stone fortress, on a cliff overlooking Havana Harbor, that had been converted into a prison. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>他站在卡巴尼亚堡（La Cabana，或称“圣卡洛斯要塞”）的护城河里，背靠布满弹孔的墙壁。这个堡垒始建于18世纪，居于俯瞰哈瓦那港口的峭壁上，如今被改造成了监狱。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Flecks of blood were drying on the patch of ground where Morgan's friend had been shot, moments earlier. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>就在刚才，摩根的朋友被枪杀，地上留下斑斑渐干的血迹。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Morgan, who was thirty-two, blinked into the lights. He faced a firing squad.The gunmen gazed at the man they had been ordered to kill. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>摩根在强光照射下眨着眼，他面前的行刑队，瞄准他，准备射击。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Morgan was nearly six feet tall, and had the powerful arms and legs of someone who had survived in the wild. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>摩根32岁，身高近6英尺，身体强壮。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>With a stark jaw, a pugnacious nose, and scruffy blond hair, he had the gallant look of an adventurer in a movie serial, of a throwback to an earlier age, and photographs of him had appeared in newspapers and magazines around the world. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>他下巴突出、鼻子尖挺，一头乱糟糟的金发，看上去像是电影里表现的早期探险家。世界各地的人们从报刊和杂志上登载的照片认识了他。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>The most alluring images--taken when he was fighting in the mountains, with Fidel Castro and Che Guevara--showed Morgan, with an untamed beard, holding a Thompson submachine gun. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>其中最吸引人的形象便是他在山里与卡斯特罗和切格瓦拉并肩战斗时拍下，他满脸恣意生长的络腮胡子，端着汤普森冲锋枪。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Though he was now shaved and wearing prison garb, the executioners recognized him as the mysteriousAmericanowho once had been hailed as a hero of the revolution.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>虽然他已刮掉胡子，身穿囚服，行刑者仍然能够认出他，这个神秘的美国佬，曾被当作革命英雄受到万众欢呼。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>It was March 11, 1961, two years after Morgan had helped to overthrow the dictator Fulgencio Batista, bringing Castro to power. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>时间定格在1961年3月11日，也就是摩根帮助推翻了古巴独裁者富尔亨西奥·巴蒂斯塔，卡斯特罗掌权仅仅两年。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>The revolution had since fractured, its leaders devouring their own, like Saturn, but the sight of Morgan before a firing squad was a shock. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>此后，革命变了样，领导人们开始自相残杀，但摩根站在行刑队面前这个场景还是令人震惊。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>In 1957, when Castro was still widely seen as fighting for democracy, Morgan had travelled from Florida to Cuba and headed into the jungle, joining a guerrilla force. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>1957年，卡斯特罗仍被广泛视为在为民主而战，摩根从佛罗里达来到古巴，进入丛林，加入了游击队。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>In the words of one observer, Morgan was "like Holden Caulfield with a machine gun." </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>当时有人说他是“端着冲锋枪的霍尔顿·考尔菲德。”</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>He was the only American in the rebel army and the sole foreigner, other than Guevara, an Argentine, to rise to the army's highest rank,comandante.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>他是唯一成为叛军高级指挥官的美国人，也是除了阿根廷人格瓦拉之外的唯一外国人。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>After the revolution, Morgan's role in Cuba aroused even greater fascination, as the island became enmeshed in the larger battle of the Cold War. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>革命成功之后，随着这个岛国被深深地卷入更大规模的冷战，摩根在古巴的角色更是让人遐想。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>An American who knew Morgan said that he had served as Castro's "chief cloak-and-dagger man," andTimecalled him Castro's "crafty, U.S.-born double agent."</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>了解摩根的一名美国人称他是卡斯特罗的“首席间谍”，《时代》周刊则直呼他为卡斯特罗手下的“出生于美国的狡诈的双料间谍。”</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Now Morgan was charged with conspiring to overthrow Castro. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>如今摩根被控阴谋推翻卡斯特罗。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>The Cuban government claimed that Morgan had actually been working for U.S. intelligence--that he was, in effect, a triple agent. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>古巴政府宣称，摩根实际上为美国情报部门工作，这样，他就成了三重间谍。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Morgan denied the allegations, but even some of his friends wondered who he really was, and why he had come to Cuba.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>摩根否认全部指控，但即使是他的朋友，也始终不明白他到底是什么人，为何来古巴。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Before Morgan was led outside La Caba?a, an inmate asked him if there was anything he could do for him. Morgan replied, "If you ever get out of here alive, which I doubt you will, try to tell people my story." </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>摩根被带到卡巴尼亚堡之前，他的狱友问能为他做什么时，摩根说：“如果你能活着出去，不过我很怀疑，那就把我的故事告诉世人。”</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Morgan grasped that more than his life was at stake: the Cuban regime would distort his role in the revolution, if not excise it from the public record, and the U.S. government would stash documents about him in classified files, or "sanitize" them by concealing passages with black ink. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>摩根明白，他失去的不仅是他的生命：古巴当局即便不会让他从官方记录中抹去，也会歪曲他在革命中的作用，而美国政府也会将涉及他的档案打上机密字样束之高阁，或者用黑墨汁涂掉关键段落，给他“消毒”。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>He would be rubbed out--first from the present, then from the past.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>他将被抹去，先是当前，然后是过去。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>The head of the firing squad shouted, "Attention!" </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>行刑队指挥官大喊：“预备！”</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Morgan feared for his wife, Olga--whom he had met in the mountains--and for their two young daughters. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>摩根此时只担心他妻子，奥尔加和两个小女儿。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>He had always managed to bend the forces of history, and he had made a last-minute plea to communicate with Castro. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>他总想扭转历史的发展轨迹，他在最后时刻还要求与卡斯特罗联系。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Morgan had believed that the man he once called his "faithful friend" would never kill him. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>摩根深信，这个人以前称他为“忠实的朋友”，不会杀他。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>But now the executioners were cocking their guns.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>但现在，行刑队正举枪对着他。</seg>

<seg>THE FIRST TRICK</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>一、牛刀初试，潜入古巴</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>When Morgan arrived in Havana, in December, 1957, he was propelled by the thrill of a secret. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>1957年12月，摩根抵达哈瓦那的时候，他内心激荡着秘密的刺激。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>He made sure that he wasn't being followed as he moved surreptitiously through the neon-lit capital. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>在他潜行于霓虹闪烁的首都时，时刻警惕着不被人跟踪。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Advertised as the "Playland of the Americas," Havana offered one temptation after another: the Sans Souci night club, where, on outdoor stages, dancers with frank hips swayed under the stars to the cha-cha; the Hotel Capri, whose slot machines spat out American silver dollars; and the Tropicana, where guests such as Elizabeth Taylor and Marlon Brando enjoyed lavish revues featuring the Diosas de Carne, or "flesh goddesses."</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>哈瓦那的广告语是“美洲的乐园，”这里有太多的诱惑：无忧宫夜总会室外舞台上表演着恰恰舞；卡普里酒店里的老虎机，吐出美国银币；热带俱乐部有富丽堂皇的滑稽剧，伊丽莎白泰勒和马龙白兰度曾在此消磨时光。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Morgan, then a pudgy twenty-nine-year-old, tried to appear as just another man of leisure. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>时年29岁的摩根，尽量装出一副来此消遣的摸样。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>He wore a two-hundred-and-fifty-dollar white suit with a white shirt, and a new pair of shoes. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>他一身白西装、白衬衫和一双新皮鞋。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>"I looked like a real fat-cat tourist," he later joked.</seg>

<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>他后来自嘲说：“我就像个来此旅游的富豪。”</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>But, according to members of Morgan's inner circle, and to the unpublished account of a close friend, he avoided the glare of the city's night life, making his way along a street in Old Havana, near a wharf that offered a view of La Caba?a, with its drawbridge and moss-covered walls. Morgan paused by a telephone booth, where he encountered a Cuban contact named Roger Rodriguez. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>但据他朋友们说，他没有流连于哈瓦那的夜生活，而是避开喧闹的人群，沿着哈瓦那老城区一条街来到能看到卡巴尼亚堡的码头，他停在一个电话亭边，与古巴的联络人罗杰罗德里格斯见面。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>A raven-haired student radical with a thick mustache, Rodriguez had once been shot by police during a political demonstration, and he was a member of a revolutionary cell.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>他是个学生，是革命小组的成员。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Most tourists remained oblivious of the many iniquities of Cuba, where people often lived without electricity or running water. Graham Greene, who published "Our Man in Havana" in 1958, later recalled, "I enjoyed the louche atmosphere of Batista's city and I never stayed long enough to become aware of the sad political background of arbitrary imprisonment and torture." </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>当时的多数旅游者都不会留意，巴蒂斯塔统治下的古巴人民，生活艰难，遭受着种种社会不公和罪恶之苦，比如随意抓人并施以酷刑。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Morgan, however, had briefed himself on Batista, who had seized power in a coup, in 1952: how the dictator liked sitting in his palace, eating sumptuous meals and watching horror films, and how he tortured and killed dissidents, whose bodies were sometimes dumped in fields, with their eyes gouged out or their crushed testicles stuffed in their mouths.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>但摩根来之前已对巴蒂斯塔有所了解。他于1952年通过政变上台，喜欢坐在宫殿里，享用着山珍海味，看恐怖片；他酷刑折磨并杀害异见者，有时会将他们的尸体弃之荒野，眼睛被挖出，嘴里塞着打碎的睾丸。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Morgan and Rodriguez resumed walking through Old Havana, and began a furtive conversation. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>摩根和罗德里格斯穿行在老城区，低声交谈。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Morgan was rarely without a cigarette, and typically communicated through a haze of smoke. He didn't know Spanish, but Rodriguez spoke broken English. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>摩根一根接一根地吸烟，他不懂西班牙语，但罗德里格斯勉强能说英语。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>They had previously met in Miami, becoming friends, and Morgan believed that he could trust him. Morgan confided that he planned to sneak into the Sierra Maestra, a mountain range on Cuba's remote southeastern coast, where revolutionaries had taken up arms against the regime. He intended to enlist with the rebels, who were commanded by Fidel Castro.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>他们此前在迈阿密相识，成了朋友。摩根觉着他值得信任，就告诉他自己想潜入古巴东南部的马埃斯特拉山脉，加入那里的革命军，也就是卡斯特罗领导的队伍。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>The name of Batista's mortal enemy carried the jolt of the forbidden. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>卡斯特罗是巴蒂斯塔的死敌，无人敢在公开场合提及他的名字。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>On November 25, 1956, Castro, a thirty-year-old lawyer and the illegitimate son of a prosperous landowner, had launched from Mexico an amphibious invasion of Cuba, along with eighty-one self-styled commandos, including Che Guevara. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>1956年11月25日，30岁的卡斯特罗率领81名敢死队员从墨西哥出发渡海杀入古巴。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>After their battered wooden ship ran aground, Castro and his men waded through chest-deep waters, and came ashore in a swamp whose tangled vegetation tore their skin. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>当他们乘坐的破木船搁浅后，他和队员们涉过齐胸深的海水，进入杂草密布的沼泽地。</seg>

<seg>他们登陆不久，便遭到政府军伏击，敢死队员之一切格瓦拉脖子中弹。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>(He later wrote, "I immediately began to wonder what would be the best way to die, now that all seemed lost.") Only a dozen or so rebels, including the wounded Guevara and Castro's younger brother, Raul, escaped, and, exhausted and delirious with thirst--one drank his own urine--they fled into the steep jungles of the Sierra Maestra.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>他后来写道：“我当即开始琢磨既然大势已去，哪种死法更好。”只有十几个叛乱分子侥幸逃脱，其中包括受伤的格瓦拉和卡斯特罗的弟弟劳尔，狼狈不堪地逃入马埃斯特拉山的密林中。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>After Batista mistakenly declared that Castro had died in the ambush, Castro allowed aTimescorrespondent, Herbert Matthews, to be escorted into the Sierra Maestra. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>巴蒂斯塔误以为卡斯特罗死于那次伏击，在他对外公布了这个消息之后，卡斯特罗准许赫伯特马修斯进入叛军在密林中的营地。</seg>

<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
