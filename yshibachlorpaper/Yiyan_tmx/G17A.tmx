<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>锣鼓喧天，扩音器放着革命歌曲，耳塞成了北京英国代办处的标准配置。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>The diplomatic round had gone on much as normal; but dinner with the Danish charg¨¦ d'affaires, amid the gleam of silverware, had also featured scenes outside the window of people being dragged out of buses and beaten in the street. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>外交谈判和往常一样进行，招待丹麦临时代办的宴会上，银器闪闪发光，窗外公交车上涌出人流，在街头厮打。</seg></tuv>

<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>对抗徒劳无益。</seg></tuv>
</tu>

<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>他用中英政府官员惯用的晦涩言辞答道，办不到。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>He was a figure who might have been at home in the Middle Kingdom, where professional scholar-officials, with the equivalent of his double starred firsts in English and law from Cambridge, kept the vast realm ticking like clockwork. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>在剑桥法律和英文均拿头等学位的他在中国觉得无拘无束，和他不相上下的中国官员都是专家学者，让这个泱泱大国一切井然有序。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Like them he was low-key but razor-sharp, happy to let ministers have their say first, but with an impish glint in his eye, or a slow steepling of his fingers, that showed he had instantly grasped the danger, or the absurdity, of a situation.</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>他行事低调、头脑敏锐，乐于让部长先发言，而他眼睛里顽皮的光芒，慢慢剔手指的动作，显示出他顿时领悟到局面的危险之处、荒诞不经。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>His regret was that he could not always lead others to grasp it too; that they could not learn to see things from the Chinese point of view. "Know your enemy" was his motto, as well as the title of his book about a late stint as chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>他很遗憾，不能总让别人明白这一点：他们没有学会从中国人的视角看问题。“认清对手”既是他的座右铭，也是描写他后来任联合情报委员会主席的书名。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>But for the British governments he served from the 1960s to the 1990s, China was simply unfathomable. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>而对他从60年代到90年代任职的英国政府而言，中国一直神秘莫测。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Even he-on his scattered tours of duty in 1962, 1966-69, 1978-84 (as ambassador) and secretly thereafter-found the changes baffling. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>柯利达先后于1962年、1966到1969年（驻华大使）、1978到1984年赴中国任职，连他都觉得这些变化令人困惑。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>One decade uniformed crowds would be chanting to Mao as the red sun shining in their hearts; the next, "louche young men in T-shirts" proclaimed Deng Xiaoping's drive to open and modernise. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>前十年，身着制服的群众歌唱毛主席是心中的红太阳。后十年，“穿T恤的叛逆青年”成了邓小平开放现代化的标志。</seg></tuv>

<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>We suck our thumbs or sleep; the show</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>吮指睡；闹剧狂</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Is gamey and too long.</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>荒唐漫长</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Beneath it all, however, he believed China preserved a self-sufficiency, secrecy and superiority that would not change, and had not done since Britain had been dismissed as "a handful of stones in the Western Ocean".</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>尽管如此，他还是相信，中国的自负、神秘和优越感不会改变，英国被当做“大西洋上的几个石块”弃之一旁，也没有办法。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Giving up Hong Kong </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>放弃香港</seg></tuv>

</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>He stayed intrigued after years of meetings with Chinese leaders who smoked, spat or pickled themselves with mao-tai. A Beijing autumn, calm and golden, with persimmons hanging like lanterns in the trees, would enchant him. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>同吸烟斗嘴、豪饮茅台的中国领导人会晤多年，他依然兴趣盎然。北京的秋天静谧金黄，树梢挂的柿子像一个个灯笼，让他心醉。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>But the romance of China was soon eclipsed by the struggle to live, as a free-thinking foreigner, within the communist system. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>身为共产党体制下思想自由的外国人，为生活斗争让中国的浪漫色彩相形见拙。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>China was, he confessed, an addiction with him. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>他坦承，对中国一往情深。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>But it was also "an acquired taste, much of it bitter".</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>这也要“慢慢才能品味，多半却是苦涩”。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>The toughest episode-though also, in his view, a triumph-came in 1983-84, with the talks that arranged the return of Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>最艰难的岁月在他眼里也是成就，那是1983到1984年，准备香港回归中国的几次谈判。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Sir Percy, as he now was, eschewed a showdown. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>柯利达爵士当时避免摊牌。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Britain "had virtually no cards"; it was therefore essential to make a deal, while pressing for whatever freedoms could be salvaged. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>英国“其实没有优势”，最重要的是达成协议，保留多少自由算多少。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Margaret Thatcher, still fiery from the Falklands war, at first disagreed with him; popular newspapers talked of betrayal. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>刚打赢马岛战争的玛格丽特·撒切尔气焰正盛，首先反对他的意见；通俗报刊声称这是背叛。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Chris Patten, who became governor of Hong Kong in 1992, pressed democracy a good deal too much for Sir Percy, who knew it would unnecessarily upset the Chinese. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>1992年接任香港总督的彭定康在民主问题上要求过多，而柯利达深知这会惹怒中国。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>He accused him, in Prospect magazine, of a "fatal miscalculation".</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>柯利达曾在《展望》杂志上指责彭定康犯了“致命的错误”。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>This was uncharacteristic. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>这不是他的性格。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Sir Percy usually made his points, and got his way, stealthily and quietly. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>柯利达爵士通常不动声色、平静温和地证明自己的观点正确，然后付诸实践。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>He would steal upstairs, when foreign-policy adviser at Number 10, to watch Wimbledon on television; he would travel incognito to Beijing, once to negotiate the new Hong Kong airport, and would be snapped pacing in the grounds of the Summer Palace, looking much like George Smiley. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>担任唐宁街10号外交政策顾问时，他会悄悄上楼去看温布尔登网球赛的转播；就香港修建新机场谈判期间，他微服旅行到北京，在颐和园的散步戛然而止，如同侦探乔治·斯迈利一样。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>But he was provoked into open war with Mr Patten by his very hatred of confrontation. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>而他深恶痛绝的冲突迫使他和彭定康公开对立。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Dealing with China and its arcana imperii was a matter for professionals, not politicians. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>对待中国及其国家机密是内行的事，而不是政治家的事。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>And his method was not surrender, though it might look as though he had put his hands up, or made a cringing kowtow to the Chinese. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>柯利达的方式不是投降，看上去好像他举起双手，对中国人俯首称臣。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>It was just, as he saw it, a nod in their direction, in a coolly realistic way.</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>在他看来，其实就是按他们的说法点头，这才是冷静现实之道。</seg></tuv>
