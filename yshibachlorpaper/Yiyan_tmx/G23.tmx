<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>In letters, essays, novels, stories, plays, and poems, Lawrence returned over and over again to those much loved landscapes which lay in the curve of the river Erewash where it divides Notinghamshire from Derbyshire. All the fields, streams, and houses which made up what he called 'the country of my heart'.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>在书信，随笔，小说，故事，喜剧和诗歌中，劳伦斯一次又一次提到这深爱着的地方，这处Erewash 河的河谷将诺丁汉和德比两个郡分开, 所有的田地、溪流、房屋，都构成了他所称的“我心之国”。</seg>
