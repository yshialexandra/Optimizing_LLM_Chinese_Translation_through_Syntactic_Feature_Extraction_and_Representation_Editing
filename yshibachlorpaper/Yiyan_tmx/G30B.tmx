<seg>When I was a fairly precocious young man I became thoroughly impressed with the futility of the hopes and strivings that chase most men restlessly through life. Moreover, I soon discovered the cruelty of that chase, which in those years was much more carefully covered up by hypocrisy and glittering words than is the case today. </seg>

<seg>第一个寻求的精神出路自然就是宗教了。每个孩子从小就被传统的教育机构灌输宗教的观念，所以我也就从一个父母都不信教的孩子变成了一个虔诚的信徒，这种情况一直持续到我１２岁那年。</seg>
