<seg>后记：墨西哥伟大的女同歌手 CHAVELA VARGAS</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>When I was twenty-three, I found myself killing time in San Joaqu¨ªn de Flores, Costa Rica. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>23岁时，我在哥斯达黎加的San Joaquín de Flores消磨了一段时光。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>The town was within commuting distance of the capital, San Jos¨¦, but had few metropolitan airs: it was a place, I was told, where addresses were unnecessary, and where, in order to find the person I was looking for, all I needed to do was ask any passerby for the "Casa de la Vargas."</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>那个小镇离首府San José不远，却没什么都市气息：人家告诉我门牌号码在那是多余的，要是想找某人，只需向任何一个路人打听“Casa de la Vargas”（Vargas的家）在哪。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>It was an unlikely place to look for Chavela Vargas, whose great age, famous affairs, and heartbreaking renditions of the Mexican classics made her one of the monuments of Latin America. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>很难相信能在这找到Chavela Vargas，高龄、风流韵事，还有令人心碎的墨西哥歌曲演绎，已经让她成为了拉丁美洲的一座丰碑。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Indeed, for the rich exoticism of the myths surrounding her life, no other singer came close. There were stories of Chavela in Acapulco in its glory days, singing at Liz Taylor's wedding and then slipping off to bed with Ava Gardner; there were stories of her speeding down the Paseo de la Reforma in the white Alfa Romeo that was a gift of the Mexican President Adolfo L¨®pez Mateos; there were even stories, which Vargas heatedly denied, of her carrying off peasant girls at gunpoint.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>实际上，就其一生充满异域风情的传说而言，没有哪个歌手能与之比肩：在Acapulco时，Chavela在Liz Taylor的婚礼上唱完歌就溜到了Ava Gardner的床上；驾着墨西哥总统Adolfo López Mateos送她的白色阿尔法罗密欧在大街上疾驰而过；有些传说连Chavela本人也绝口否认，譬如用枪挟持农民的女儿。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Majestic and beautiful until the very end of her life, she compiled an amorous r¨¦sum¨¦ that ranks among the most distinguished in the history of twentieth-century lesbianism. </seg>

<seg>She had an affair with the magnate and collector Dolores Olmedo; rumor linked her to fellow-divas Lola Beltr¨¢n and Mar¨ªa F¨¦lix; and then, she told me in Costa Rica, she had lived a great passion with "the most famous woman in the world." </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>传言她跟富婆及收藏家Dolores Olmedo有私情，跟歌剧搭档Lola Beltrán和 María Félix有绯闻，后来，她在哥斯达黎加告诉我，她跟“世界上最有名的女人”热恋过。</seg>

<seg>The queen of the bohemians of the Plaza Garibaldi, the traditional center of Mexican music, Vargas saw her life almost destroyed by drink; she consumed it such quantities that she later joked that there was no decent tequila left in Mexico-she and the songwriter Jos¨¦ Alfredo Jim¨¦nez, another musical legend, had polished it all off. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>在墨西哥音乐的传统中心Plaza Garibaldi，严重的酗酒几乎毁了这位放荡不羁的女王一生，以至她后来曾开玩笑说墨西哥已经没有像样的龙舌兰酒了—全被她和词作家José Alfredo Jiménez（另一个音乐传奇）喝光了。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Jim¨¦nez died from cirrhosis, in 1973, and Chavela's own alcoholism was so devastating that she disappeared entirely for more than fifteen years. </seg>

<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>She attributed her pain to her terrible upbringing in Costa Rica, where, as a child in San Joaqu¨ªn, she was tormented for her sexuality ("What hurts isn't being homosexual," she said, "it's that people throw it in your face as if it were a plague"), and to her early struggles in Mexico, where she arrived as a teen-ager. She claimed that she had sold some chickens to pay for the bus fare. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>她将自己的痛苦归结于早期在哥斯达黎加的不幸童年，孩提时因为自己的性别而备受困扰（“真正痛苦的不是同性恋自身”她说“而是人们像对待瘟疫一样对待同性恋”），十几岁时到墨西哥谋生，车费是她卖了一些鸡得来的。</seg>

<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>When I first heard her, on a CD a friend lent me in college, I couldn't believe, first of all, that that murky, rough voice was a woman's. And I couldn't believe that the songs were the same anthems-with their sequined interpretresses, sombreroed mariachis, and screeching ai-yai-yais-that provided the backdrop to the margaritas of my youth. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>我第一次听她的歌是一张从大学朋友那里借来的CD ，真不敢相信那么浑浊粗哑的声音来自一个女人，而且唱的都是同样的赞歌，带着亮片的女歌者，戴墨西哥帽的流浪乐队，ai-yai-yai的高亢嘶吼，我年少时期对墨西哥鸡尾酒的体味就来自于此。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>What was easy to believe, hearing the voice, was that Chavela Vargas had known an uncommon share of hard luck. </seg>

<seg>毋庸置疑的是，人们从Chavela Vargas歌声里感受到的饱经沧桑。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>And as she uncovered the core of poetic emotion in those cheesy old songs, she enunciated, for me, a longing that I had vaguely felt since adolescence: a first intuition of adult passion, of loves that burn all the more brightly because they are fleeting.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>她对那些老歌直白而精到的演绎，是我自青春期后一直渴求而不得的：对情欲对爱的第一直觉，因为转瞬即逝而愈加灼热和鲜明。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>From the moment I heard that recording, I was infatuated. </seg>

<seg>听完那张唱片我就迷恋上了她。</seg>
</tuv>

<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>As I found more and more of her albums, I grew determined to track her down, and when at last I discovered her, in Costa Rica taking care of her ailing sister Ofelia, I headed there as soon as I could. Once there, however, it was not easy to find her. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">

<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>As promised, the "Casa de la Vargas" was known to every citizen. But she was so persistently not home that after a few days of trying, I assumed she didn't want to see me, and headed to Nicaragua. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>就像那人所说的，Casa de la Vargas在镇上人尽皆知，但我去的那几天她却一直不在家，料想是她不想见我，就去了尼加拉瓜。</seg>

<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>When I returned to Costa Rica, I tried again. This time, Vargas picked up the phone and told me to come right on over.</seg>

<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>If Costa Rica is today the only Latin American country that might fairly be described as suburban, in her childhood it was a harsh, isolated, conservative place, as far from the cultural ferment of Mexico as Dubuque is from Manhattan. "Ten families own this whole country," she said, eyes widening with dismay. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>倘若今天的哥斯达黎加是唯一可被称为郊区的拉美国家，那么在她童年时期这儿就是一个残酷、孤立、保守的地方，就像Dubuque对曼哈顿那样疏远了墨西哥文化的融合。“十个家族掌管着这个国家”她说，眼神里泛着沮丧。</seg>

<seg>When I took it out of my bag, I first observed a rule I have since seen proven again and again: as a change comes over the features of a person being photographed, a voice that knows it is being recorded changes, too. </seg>

<seg>Before I turned it on, Chavela was relaxed. On the sofa that doubled as her bed, she inquired about my trip to Nicaragua and peered anxiously into my coffee to make sure I didn't really want sugar.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>在我开始录音之前，Chavela一直很放松，坐在有她的床两倍大的沙发上，她询问我在尼加拉瓜的旅行，忧虑地盯着我的咖啡确定我真的不需要加糖。</seg>

<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>When I fumblingly hit the "record" button, the friendly old lady's voice gained the enunciation of a prima donna, the informal accent ceding to the careful syllables of an unschooled woman eager not to betray her lack of education. </seg>

<seg>Here was the great singer, and here was her mythology-the Indian family that had saved her from alcoholism, for example, and the tribe that had anointed her a shaman (La Chamana was one of her nicknames). </seg>

<seg>She repeatedly mentioned how her "spouse," Pedro Almod¨®var, had put her music in his films; and how Isabel Preysler, Julio Iglesias's glamorous ex-wife, had recently thrown a party for her in Madrid; and how the then-President of Argentina, Fernando de la R¨²a, had personally begged her to stay in Buenos Aires. </seg>

<seg>"I lifted his songs to the height of glory," she declaimed, speaking of places unfathomably distant from that little apartment. "I took them to the Olympia, in Paris, to the Palau de la M¨²sica, in Barcelona, to the greatest theatres in the world."</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>“我把他的歌曲发扬光大”她说道，报出一些与这个小公寓相去甚远的地名“我把它们带到奥林匹亚、巴黎、帕劳、巴塞罗拉，去世界上最好的剧院。”</seg>

<seg>Among her standards were Mario Clavel's "Somos," with which Almod¨®var opened "Live Flesh," and a hymn to a weeping woman of Mexican legend, "La llorona," which Chavela, dressed as Death, sang in Julie Taymor's "Frida." </seg>
</tuv>

<seg>The setting for these songs is the bar; the beverage, tequila; the singer, a lover drowning his sorrows.

"Share this bottle with me," "En el Ultimo Trago" continues.</seg>
