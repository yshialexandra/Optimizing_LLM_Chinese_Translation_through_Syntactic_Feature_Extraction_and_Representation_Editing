</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>A reclusive, mythomanic soi-disant aristocrat, he was best known for his luminous if troubling paintings of adolescent girls. Replete with dreamy introspection and sexual readiness, his figures stare out of windows or stand on step-ladders in trees, gazing into the distance in an atmosphere loaded with erotic tension.</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>这个自诩为贵族的渲染狂隐居士，以他直白且易招引麻烦的少女画作而闻名，充满了梦幻般的反思与性欲的画中，他的那些人物或凝视窗外或站在立于树上的梯子上，望向远方，气氛充满色情味儿。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Such work brought him a reputation as an artist with an obsession with young girls. But Balthus made a show of appearing indifferent to this suggestion. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>这些画作使他以对少女的迷恋艺术家的身份闻名于世，但是他对自己的这个身份表示不屑。</seg></tuv>

<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>他坚持说那些对我产品的解读在大多数情况下都是误读。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>His supporters claimed that the mood of elegy and hope in his most typical paintings portrayed something more subtle, a loss of innocence. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>他的拥趸则声称他多数画中传达出的哀怨与希望其实描绘的是更隐晦的情感：天真的流失。</seg></tuv>
</tu>

<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Balthus, characteristically, was non-committal. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>而贝尔蒂斯自己对此态度暧昧。</seg></tuv>

<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>只说了一句：每个人看到的都是他想看到的。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>His reticence extended to personal publicity of any kind. When pressed by the Tate Gallery in 1968 for biographical information for an exhibition catalogue, he cabled: "No biographical details. Begin: Balthus is a painter of whom nothing is known. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>他的沉默寡言贯穿于他所有公众形象的展示上，1968年，当塔特艺术馆在制作展会目录征求他的传记信息时，他回到：没有传记信息，就此开头吧：贝尔蒂斯是个无任何信息的艺术家。</seg></tuv>

<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>It was an approach reminiscent of that adopted by Greta Garbo, and one that similarly only heightened curiosity about him. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>而这种处世方式似乎有着格丽泰.嘉宝的痕迹，恰巧的是，而她当年也曾唯独对他提升过自己的好奇。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>It did the prices of his paintings no harm either. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>但这都没有对他画作的价格产生过任何负面影响。</seg></tuv>

<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>他是他那个时代里少数寻求各种方式去传达美的艺术家。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>His drawing is in a class with Courbet, Cezanne, Seurat and Picasso in his periode rose, while his painting comes closest in spirit to that of Piero della Francesca, blending realism with the spiritual.</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>融合了现实与精神世界，他的作品在同一时期是与库尔贝，赛尚，修拉和毕加索等并驾齐驱的，在精神层面也是跟皮耶罗德拉佛朗西斯最气息相投。 </seg></tuv>

<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>It was one he undertook almost every day, even into his nineties, rarely inviting anyone into the sanctum of his studio, even such close friends as Alberto Giacometti and Henri Cartier-Bresson. Yet the results of his meditation seemed to many closer to blasphemy. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>即时迈入九十岁的耄耋之年，这也是他每天的修行。他几乎不请任何人到他的工作室，即使那些至亲如阿尔伯特贾科梅蒂和亨利卡蒂埃，但他的修行与冥想的成果似乎与亵渎神明无异。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Indeed, the painting which first brought him to notice, The Guitar Lesson (1934), has a markedly similar composition to the Pieta de Villeneuve-les-Avignons in the Louvre.</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>确实，那幅让他成为焦点的 the guitar lesson吉他课（1934）与卢浮宫的那幅阿维尼翁新城 the Pieta de Villeneuve-les-Avignons有惊人的相似之处。</seg></tuv>

<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>In the picture, a teenage girl is shown stretched over the knees of another - her young music teacher - who gazes down at her pupil's naked abdomen while tugging on her hair as if handing out a punishment. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>画中，一个十几岁的少女身体横陈在另一个人的腿上-她年轻的吉他老师。而他则低头凝视着她裸露着的小腹双手用力拉扯着她的秀发，像是在体罚她。</seg></tuv>

<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Nonetheless, it caused a sensation, and as late as 1978 it was withdrawn from an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York because of speculation about its subject matter.</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>尽管如此。这幅画还是引起了些许反响，考虑到这幅画其中的主旨，这幅画于1978年才从纽约现代艺术博物馆的展览中被提走。</seg></tuv>

<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Thereafter Balthus was dogged by a reputation for perversion. </seg></tuv>

</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>He was born Balthasar Klossowski in Paris on February 29 1908, the second son of German-born painters. His father, Erich Klossowski, was also an art critic, and was proud of being the only German admitted to the circle of Pierre Bonnard and friends, which included Matisse. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>贝尔蒂斯 原名巴尔塔扎·克洛索夫斯基，1908年2月29日生于巴黎，家中的二子，他父亲埃里克克洛索夫斯基是位德国裔画家，同时也是位艺术批评家，并以被包括马尔提斯在内的波奈尔朋友圈认可的唯一一位德国人而自豪。</seg></tuv>

</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Balthasar was encouraged to paint by Bonnard, but it was the poet Rainer Maria Rilke, who had a long affair with Balthus's mother, who recognised the 12-year-old boy as a prodigy when he saw a series of 40 ink drawings by him. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>在波纳尔的鼓励下，贝尔蒂斯开始作画，但其实是一位叫赖内·马利亚·里尔克（rainer marica rilke）的诗人在看到他画的一系列共40幅的墨水画之后发现贝尔蒂斯就是一个神童。这位诗人与其母亲曾有很长一段时间的婚外情。</seg></tuv>

<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Mitsou told the tale of a lost cat, and Balthus liked to compare himself to the animal. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>Mitsou 是本讲述一只流浪猫故事的书。而贝尔蒂斯也总是喜欢拿自己跟动物比较。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Certainly there was something feline about his lazy, mischievous, rather manipulative nature. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>当然他身上确实有些猫科动物的特性：慵懒，顽皮，控制欲强。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>His favourite of his own works - and the only one he retained to the end of his life - was a self-portrait from 1935 which depicts an angular young man with a tawny cat. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>他自己最喜欢的也是保留到他生命最后的一幅画是1935年分的自画像：一个戴茶色帽子的消瘦男子。</seg></tuv>

<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>在他职业生涯之初，他把自己作品定位为传统的叙事性画作，孩童时期，他曾在卢浮宫用三个月的时间专用来临摹普桑的回声和水仙花。</seg></tuv>

<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>A 1927 portrait of Balthus by Man Ray captures the painter's indifference to the vagaries of artistic fashion. His aquiline features are accentuated and he looks aristocratic and ascetic, sitting smoking from a cigarette-holder and gazing off camera.</seg></tuv>

</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>No more plausible was his story that he was related to Byron, a fantasy that revealed the romanticism in his nature. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>而他说他自己跟拜伦是亲戚的故事也是子虚乌有的事情，这种幻想也正反映了他骨子里的浪漫主义情怀。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>In 1933, after spending a year in Morocco on national service, Balthus created a series of prints illustrating Wuthering Heights. Balthus closely identified with Heathcliff, modelling the character's features in the prints on his own.</seg></tuv>

<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>His work in Rome left him little time for painting, but once he had retired to Rossiniere, in Switzerland, where he lived in a large 19th-century chalet, his painting seemed to reach a new standard. The Turkish Room (1963-66) depicts a nude Chinese girl reclining on a sofa in a shuttered and elaborately furnished room. The decorative orientalism of this painting, completed with an almost other-worldly grace, forms a striking contrast to the solid, bourgeois figures of Balthus's early work.</seg></tuv>
