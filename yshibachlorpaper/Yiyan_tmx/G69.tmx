<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>During this comatose period I went through a wonderful learning process. I prayed most of the time, although I was unconscious and could not speak or respond. I still prayed in my heart, and I understood everything that was going on around me. I remembered all of the conversations that were spoken in my room, and I have written them in my book My Glimpse of Eternity. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>在这段昏迷不醒的期间我经历了一个奇妙的学习过程，大部分时间我都在祷告，虽然我那时神志不清，不能说话，也无法回应别人，但我的心里一直在祈祷，而且我知道发生在身边的每件事。我记得所有发生在我病房的谈话，我把这些谈话都在我写的书《我对永生的一瞥》中记下来了。</seg>

<seg>I heard Jack Holcolme singing 'The old account was settled long ago'. How thankful I was that at the age of 13, I had settled my account with sin. I had decided to invite Jesus be the Lord of my life, forgiving me of my sins, and experienced the new birth. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>其中一首是杰克赫尔科姆的“旧账在很久前就还清了”，多么感恩啊！我在13岁那年就还清了罪债，那年我决定邀请耶稣成为我生命的主，赦免我的罪，并经历了重生。</seg>

<seg>He said that all he could think of to say was to breathe one word of prayer for himself, asking God through this prayer to give him strength to break the news to my husband. He also prayed for my daughter, Brenda, who would be very distressed when she heard the news that her mother had died. </seg>

<seg>在那道光的中间，我看到一些乳白色的两英寸大小的字母向我飘来，这让我想起了阿特向我读过的：“他发命医治他们。”</seg>
