<seg>This had sounded too vague - too 20th-century - to be truly credible, so my sister and I attempted a number of times to exchange texts, out of habit and idle hope, before admitting that we were wholly defeated.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>这个理由听起来太牵强——太二十世纪——没有可信度。出于习惯，我和我妹妹带着渺茫的希望尝试了好多次互发短信，不过到最后我们只能承认失败。</seg>

<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Then in March 2007, when the old man passed on after a long illness, my sister took another crack at it. </seg>

<seg>I grew up around him, accustomed to his presence at home: to his shirtless torso, brown as a violin; to the angle at which he arced his leanness over the newspaper; to the ellipses of sunlight in which he liked to sit, in feline habit, next to the window; to the low bicker of his voice in prayer; to his twitchy handwriting; and, in his final years, to the degree of cloudiness in his fast-fading eyes. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>我在他身边长大，早就习惯了他在家里的存在：他打着赤膊时的小提琴般棕色的躯干；他看报纸时，弓起的瘦削脊背；他喜欢像猫那样懒洋洋地靠在窗边享受那片阴凉；还有他那娓娓轻柔的祈祷声，跳动不安的字迹；以及，在祖父人生的最后几年里他那逐渐失神的双眼中的阴翳。</seg>

<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>祖父并不是那种容易害羞或者不善于社交的人，而且，在我还年幼的时候，我的祖父花了不少心思来照顾我，以至于我关于那些年的记忆，能像一副祖孙蒙太奇的拼接画一样揉在一起。</seg>

<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Here he is, dropping me off on his bicycle at the stop for my school bus. Here he is, sitting with me, watching the cricketer Patrick Patterson bowl on our black-and-white television.

<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>在这幅画卷里祖父送我到校车巴士站，然后把我从单车上抱了下来；祖父和我一起坐在黑白电视前，看着板球手帕特里克·帕特森的比赛；祖父总是从那似乎永不枯竭的印度神话中选取故事，然后给我讲一个个戏剧化得让人瞠目结舌的故事；他教我数学，他的思维迅猛可谓电光火石。</seg>

<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Some of the items on this roster appear trivial: unhealthy skin, for instance, or being restless readers, or being particular about our meals, or being particular really about the way most things are done. </seg>

<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>清单上的条目有些过于琐碎，比如：不健康的肤色、手不释卷、对食物特别挑剔、对大多数事情都有独特的处理方式。</seg>

<seg>But there were also deeper kinships: an impatience with fools; a meticulous industry; an unending love of language; a certain self-sufficiency that makes it difficult to feel lonely, but that renders a rare spell of loneliness all the more fearsome and crippling. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>但我们之间也有更深层次的联系，例如：同样地对工具不耐烦、做事一丝不苟、对语言无止境的热爱、自信得很难感觉到孤独，但是它在某些时候带来的孤独感不仅使我们不寒而栗更深受其害。</seg>

<seg>Even so, my grandfather always felt like a special case - less a real person than a character pulled out of a fable, his abilities and his flaws both immensely larger than life, and his past obscured as much by my own ignorance as by the half-truths and legends that swirl around him.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>虽然如此，我的祖父常常就像一个特例——他比寓言故事里的传奇人物更不真实，他的能力和缺点都远远超出了生活，由于我自身的无知和围绕着他的带有传奇色彩、真假参半的传言，他的过去愈加扑朔迷离。</seg>
