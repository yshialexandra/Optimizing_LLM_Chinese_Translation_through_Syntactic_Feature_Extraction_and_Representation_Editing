<seg>Like many people of her generation, those born before Independence, my mother viewed gloom as unpatriotic. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>“ 和那些在印度独立前出生、与她同龄的人一样，母亲将悲天悯人视作不爱国的表现。</seg>

<seg>To complain was to show that you were not willing to accept difficulties, that you were not willing to do the hard work that was needed to build the country.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>喋喋不休的抱怨说明这人不愿接受困难，不愿意为建设国家付出辛苦劳动。</seg>

<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>父亲看到的是无处不在的欺骗和自私自利。</seg>

<seg>他不仅看到这些，同时也认为其他人都看到了，只是故意不愿承认。</seg>

<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>My mother's irritation at his spitting blood he interpreted as hypocrisy.</seg>
</tuv>

<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>His wish rose out of self-loathing. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>这一愿望始于自我厌恶。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Often when he walked down the street in Delhi, he would feel that the buildings he passed were indifferent to him, that he mattered so little to them that he might as well not have been born. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>走在德里市街道上，父亲时常会感觉身边经过的建筑对他是那么的冷漠；在这些建筑面前他无足轻重，好像从来不曾来到这个世界。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Because he attributed this feeling to his circumstances-and not to the fact that he was the sort of person who sensed buildings' having opinions-he believed that if he were somewhere else, especially somewhere where he was paid in dollars and thus was rich, he would be a different person and one whose life had meaning.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>他将这种感受归咎于自身所处的大环境，而不是因为他是那种能感知建筑能表达观点的人。所以他觉得要是在其他地方，尤其是用美元支付报酬，让他变得富有的地方，他将会脱胎换骨、与众不同，而他的人生也将充满意义。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Another reason he wanted to emigrate was that he saw the West as glamorous with the excitement of science. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>父亲想移民的另一个原因在于西方社会的科学发展对他来说充满神奇的吸引力。</seg>
</tuv>

<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>In India in the fifties, sixties, and seventies, radios, televisions, and cars were not just expensive objects but seen as almost supernatural. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>五六七十年代的印度，广播、电视、汽车不仅仅是昂贵的奢侈品，它们简直是遥不可及的超自然神物。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>I remember that when we turned on the radio in our apartment, as the vacuum tubes warmed up, first the voices would sound far away and then they would rush at us, and this was thrilling, as if the machine were making some special effort for us.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>还记得当年我们在住处打开收音机，电子真空管开始预热，一开始出来的声音像从遥远的地方传来，然后突然逼近。太神奇了，好像这台机器正为我们做一些特别的努力。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Of everybody in my family, my father loved science the most. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>家人中，父亲最热衷科学。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>He tried to bring it into his life by going to medical clinics and having his urine tested. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>他也努力将科学带到生活中来：他会到诊所检测自己的尿液。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>He loved clinics and doctors' offices. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>他很喜欢诊所和医生办公室。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Of course, hypochondria had something to do with this; my father suspected that there was something wrong with him and that it might be something physical. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>当然，臆想症和这有很大的关系。父亲总疑心自己有问题，可能是身体方面。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Also, sitting in the clinics and talking to doctors in lab coats, he felt that he was close to important things, that what the doctors were doing was the same as what doctors would do in England or Germany or America, that he was already there in those foreign countries.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>再说，坐在诊所与那些身穿白色大褂的医生们交谈，让父亲觉得自己就在那些重要的事情身边，这里的医生们所做的事情与在英国、德国或美国的同行们是一样的，所以他觉得自己俨然已经身处西方国家。</seg>
</tuv>

<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>My mother had no interest in emigrating for herself. </seg>
</tuv>

<seg>她在一所高中教经济学，很喜欢这份工作。</seg>

<seg>But she thought that the West would provide me and my brother, Birju, with opportunities.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>但是她认为西方社会可以给我和哥哥比尔杰提供更多机会。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Then came the Emergency. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>后来印度发生紧急状况。</seg>

<seg>My parents, like almost everyone who had seen Independence come, were very loyal; they were the sort of people who looked up at a cloud and thought, That's an Indian cloud. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>与几乎所有亲历过独立时刻到来的人们一样，父母是忠贞爱国的。只要抬头仰望天上的云朵，他们也会觉得，哦，那是我们印度的云。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>After the Emergency, however, they began to think that even though they were ordinary and unlikely to get into political trouble, it might still be better to emigrate.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>但紧急状况事件之后，他们开始思索，即便是普通民众，即便不可能卷入政治纷争，最好还是移民离开这。</seg>

<seg>I used to assume that my father had been assigned to us by the government. This was because he appeared to serve no purpose. </seg>

<seg>过去我总觉得父亲是政府部门派到我们家来的，因为他好像没有任何作用。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>When he got home in the evening, all he did was sit in his chair in the living room, drink tea, and read the paper. Often he looked angry. </seg>

<seg>下班回到家，坐在客厅椅子上，喝喝茶、看看报；总是看上去闷闷不乐。</seg>
