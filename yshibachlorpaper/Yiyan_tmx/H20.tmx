<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>This was taking a great risk, but the plan succeeded from this point onward, the island was captured and the other "oil spots" liberated.

<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>克里特行动总结出的另一条重要经验是空降部队的指挥官应在空降最初即亲临一线，唯有这样，各战斗单位才能在行动伊始获得更为准确的命令。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>The over-all command, however, must direct operations from the jump-off base and influence the outcome by making a timely decision as to where a point of main effort should be built up, and by proper commitment of reserves. </seg></tuv>

<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Three methods were used during World War II to land troops from the air at their place of commitment. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>在二战中，我们可以采用三种方法投送部队到指定位置。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Troops could be landed by parachute, by transport gliders released from tow planes, or by landing of transport planes. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>分别是使用降落伞、牵引机拖曳的滑翔机或者运输机空运输送到任务地点。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>All three methods were used in varied combinations, depending upon the situation. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>三种方法可根据战场形势结合使用。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>In accordance with the lessons derived from World War II, the last method, for reasons which will be discussed later, is unsuitable for the initial capture of enemy territory from the air, that is, the creation of an airhead. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>从二战的经验来看，第三种方法并不适用于空降作战的初期阶段（打开空降场），因此我们将在后面详细讨论。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Accordingly, only the commitment of paratroopers and gliderborne troops will be discussed here. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>我们在这里先讨论伞降和机（滑翔机）降部队。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>(German experiences in the technique and tactics of these two methods are described in detail in the appendix.) </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>（关于德军伞降和滑翔机降的技术和战术经验将在附录中说明。）</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>The advantages and the disadvantages of the two methods will be compared here and conclusions drawn as to their future use.</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>我们将比较这两种方法的优劣并探讨他们在未来的运用。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Commitment of gliders has the great advantage that they land their whole load in one place. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>滑翔机降的最大优点就是运载的部队或物资输送到同一个地点。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Since debarkation is a matter of seconds, the troops can bring their full fire and striking power to bear immediately after landing. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>降落后几秒钟内，空降兵就可以全副武装的投入行动。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>The almost noiseless approach of the gliders, which have been released from the tow planes far from the objective, increases the element of surprise. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>距目的地相当距离时滑翔机即与牵引机分离，所以滑翔机基本是无声的，可以保证行动实施的突然性。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Furthermore, diving gliders are able to make very accurate spot landings within a limited area. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>而且可操作的滑翔机能精确的降落在指定地点。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Glider troops are also able to open fire with aircraft armament upon an enemy ready to repulse them. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>机降部队还可利用机载武器立刻对地面敌人发起反击。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>German parachute troops were convinced that this would have an excellent effect on morale. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>德国空降兵认为这一点非常影响士气。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>In practice the method was used only once, so far as is known, and that was on a very small scale in July 1944 at Vassieux against the French maquis, but its success was outstanding. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>就目前所知，机载武器实施压制仅在一次小规模的战斗中获得运用，即1944年7月在Vassieux反击法国游击队的行动，但取得的成绩是非常突出的。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>While the glider offers pronounced advantages during the first attack on an objective which is defended, in the subsequent phases of the airborne operation its advantages over the use of parachutes lie in the fact that it can deliver substantially greater loads, such as heavy weapons, guns, tanks, and trucks.</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>滑翔机在针对有防卫目标进行的突击行动中有显著的优势，而后阶段的空降中，滑翔机因可以携带大量重型装备（重型武器、枪械、坦克、卡车），也会比伞降有优势。</seg></tuv>
