<seg>This change in the nature of mathematics, beginning around 600 B.C.E., was related to the great differences between the emerging Greek civilization and the civilizations of Egypt and Babylonia. The geography of Greece, primarily mountains and islands, effectively prohibited the development of large-scale agriculture. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>约公元前600年，数学的本质发生了改变，这种改变与正在诞生的希腊文明和埃及、巴比伦文，明间的巨大差异有关，希腊处于山脉和岛屿的地理环境中。</seg>

<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>As a possible consequence of this, Greece did not develop a central government. The Greeks' basic political organization was the polis, or city-state. The governments of the city-state were varied, but none controlled populations of more than a few thousand. Whether the governments were democratic or monarchical, they were not arbitrary. Each government was ruled by law, and thus its citizens were motivated to learn the skills of argument and debate. It was perhaps this atmosphere that promoted the necessity for proof in mathematics.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>这限制了大规模农业生产的发展，因此导致的可能结果是希腊人没有建立中夹集权政府，希腊的主要行政机构是大小不同的城邦政府（polis），各个城邦也只有几千人，我们无法断定它们的政府是民主制还是专制制，但一定是按法律统治的，这样就激发其臣民学习辩论的技巧，很可能是这种气氛促进了证明数学的产生。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Because virtually every city-state had access to the sea, there was constant trade, both within Greece itself and with other civilizations. As a result, the Greeks were exposed to many different peoples and, in fact, themselves settled in areas all around the eastern Mediterranean. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>由于各个城邦离海很近，所以它们与希腊其它的城邦和其它国家有经常的贸易往来，这样，希腊与不同的民族进行交流，希腊人也遍及东地中海的各个地方。</seg>
</tuv>

<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>At the same time, a rising standard of living helped attract to Greece able people from other parts of the world. Hence the Greeks were exposed to differing answers to fundamental questions about the world and they began to create their own answers. </seg>

<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>同时，希腊不断提高的生活水平吸引了世界各地的人才，他们纷纷来到希腊，这有助于希腊人了解许多基本问题的各种不同的答案后，进一步做出自己的答案。</seg>
