<seg>第九章 不情愿的企业家们</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>A businessman sitting next to us on a plane many years ago described how, when he returned to India in the mid-1970s after completing his MBA in the United States, his uncle had taken him out for a lesson in true entrepreneurship. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>很多年前，在飞机上坐我们旁边的一位商人曾对我们说，20世纪70年代中期，他从美国读完MBA回到印度，他的叔叔带他去体验一种真正的企业家精神。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>It was early one morning when he and his uncle headed for the Bombay (as Mumbai was then called) Stock Exchange. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>那是一个早晨，他和叔叔动身前往孟买股票交易所。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>But instead of going into the modern tower that houses the exchange, his uncle wanted him to observe four women who were sitting on the sidewalk, facing the road in front of the exchange. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>然而，他们并没有进入交易所所在的那座现代大楼，他的叔叔让他观察坐在路边的4个女人，她们面向着交易所前方的那条路。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>The aspiring businessman and his uncle stood for a few moments watching them. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>这位商人和他的叔叔在那儿站了一会儿，观察着那4个女人。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>The women mostly did nothing. But occasionally, when the traffic stopped, they would get up, scrape something off the road, and put it in plastic carrier bags next to them, before returning to their seats. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>她们几乎什么也没做，但是当来往车辆不多时，她们偶尔起身从路上捡点儿什么，放入她们身边的塑料袋里，然后坐回原位。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>After this happened several times, the uncle asked him if he understood their business model. He confessed to be baffled. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>反复几次之后，他的叔叔问他是否知道他们在干什么，他坦然承认自己一头雾水。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>So the uncle had to explain: Every morning before dawn the women went to the beach, where they collected wet sea sand. They then laid it evenly on the street before the real traffic began. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>于是，他的叔叔解释说，每天黎明之前，这几个女人都会去海边收集湿海沙，然后在交通繁忙之前将海沙平铺在路面上，</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>When the cars started driving over the sand, the heat from their wheels dried it. All they had to do then was occasionally to scrape off the top layer of sand, now dry. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>当车子碾过路面的海沙时，车轮散发的热气会烘干海沙，而她们所要做的就是，偶尔起身捡起表层干燥的海沙。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>By nine or ten, they had a quantity of dry sand, which they brought back to the slum to sell in small packets made from discarded newspapers: The local women used the dry sand to scrub their dishes. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>几天之后，她们就会积攒很多干燥的海沙，并将它们带回贫民窟，用由废旧报纸做的小口袋装好，拿到市场上去卖。当地妇女用干沙擦洗盘子。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>This, the uncle reckoned, was true entrepreneurship: If you have very little, use your ingenuity to create something out of nothing.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>他的叔叔认为，这就是真正的企业家精神：如果你所拥有的不多，那么就用你的聪明才智，做到从无到有。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Women from slums who manage to make a living, quite literally, from the wheels of Bombay’s commerce epitomize the incredible spirit of innovation and entrepreneurship the poor often display. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>贫民窟的女人为了谋生，会充分利用孟买的商业契机，这展现了穷人所具备的创新与企业家精神。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>This book could easily be filled with stories of creativity and resilience among owners of small-scale enterprises. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>在本书中，我们讲述了一些小企业主创新自强的故事。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Such images have been a powerful motivation for the recent microfinance and “social business” movement, which starts from the premise that the poor are natural-born entrepreneurs, and we can eradicate poverty by giving them the right environment and a little bit of help getting started. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>对于近期的小额信贷“社会交易”运动来说，这是一种有利的推动。因为，这一运动的前提就是，穷人天生就具备企业家的潜质。因此，只要为他们提供适当的环境及在起步时的一点儿推力，我们就能够消除贫穷。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>In the words of John Hatch, the CEO of FINCA, one of the largest microfinance institutions in the world: “Give poor communities the opportunities, and get out of the way.”</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>国际社区援助基金会是世界上最大的一家小额信贷机构，其首席执行官约翰·凯奇曾说过：“给贫穷社区一些机会，然后就放手。”</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Yet there are some perhaps surprising instances when, after you have gotten out of the way, the poor do not seem so ready to roll. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>然而，或许还有这样一些令人惊讶的例子，如果你真的放手，穷人似乎并不会有所作为。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Since 2007, we have been working with Al Amana, one of Morocco’s largest MFIs, to evaluate the impact of access to microcredit in rural communities that had previously been completely excluded from formal financial sources. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>自2007年起，我们一直与AL Amana（摩洛哥最大的一家小额信贷机构）共同评估小额信贷业务对农村社区的影响。这些社区以前从来没有接触过正式的金融渠道。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>After about two years, it became evident that Al Amana was not getting as many clients in the villages as had been anticipated. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>约两年之后，很明显，ALAmana并没有在农村实现预期的客户人数。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Despite the lack of alternatives, less than one in six eligible families was interested in a loan. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>尽管选择性有限，但对贷款感兴趣且具备条件的家庭仍然不到六分之一。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>To try to understand why, we went with some Al Amana staff to interview a few families in a village called Hafret Ben Tayeb, where no one had borrowed. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>为了找到原因，我们同ALAmana的几位员工来到一个名为哈福莱特的村庄（那里没人贷过款），对那里的几个家庭进行了家访。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>We were received by Allal Ben Sedan, the father of three sons and two daughters, all adults. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>我们见到了阿拉·本·希达，他有三个儿子和两个女儿，都已长大成人。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>He had four cows, one donkey, and eighty olive trees. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>希达还有4头牛、一匹毛驴和8棵橄榄树。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>One of his sons worked in the army; another tended to the animals; the third was mostly idle (his main activity was harvesting snails when they were in season). </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>他的一个儿子参军了，另一个儿子负责照看牲畜，而第三个儿子却整天无所事事。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>We asked Ben Sedan whether he would want to take a loan to buy some more cows, which his idle son could take care of. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>我们问希达，是否愿意贷款多买几头牛，让他的第三个儿子负责照看。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>He explained that his field was too small—if he bought more cows they would have nowhere to graze. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>他解释说，家里的地太少了——如果买更多的牛，可能就没有地方放牧了。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Before leaving, we asked him if there was anything else he could do with a loan. He replied, “No, nothing. We have enough. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>在离开之前，我们问他是否需要贷款买点儿什么，他回答说：“什么都不用买，我们拥有的东西已经足够了。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>We have cows, we sell them, we sell the olives. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>我们可以把牛卖掉，还可以卖橄榄。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>That is enough for our family.”</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>这对于我们一家人来说，已经足够了。”</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>A few days later, we met Fouad Abdelmoumni, the founder (and then CEO) of Al Amana, a man of great warmth and intelligence, who in a previous life as an activist had spent years in jail as a political prisoner and was entirely devoted to improving the lives of the poor. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>几天之后，我们见到了AL Amana的创始人兼首席执行官福阿德，他是一个充满热情、极具才智的人，以前是一名政治积极分子，曾因犯政治错误蹲过几年监狱，他一直致力于改善穷人的生活。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>We discussed the surprisingly low demand for microcredit. In particular, we went back to the story of Ben Sedan, who was convinced that he had no use for more money. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>我们一起探讨了小额信贷的低需求问题，还特别提到了希达的故事——他确信自己不需要更多的钱。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Fouad drew up a clearly feasible business plan for him. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>福阿德为希达设计了一个明确可行的计划。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>He could take a loan, build a stable, and buy four young cows. They would not need to graze in a field: They could be fed in the stable. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>他可以贷款建一座牛棚，然后再买4头小牛，这样就不用再到田里放牧了，可以在牛棚里喂养它们。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Within eight months, he could sell the cows for a hefty profit. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>8个月之后，他就可以将牛卖掉，并得到一笔丰厚的利润。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Fouad was persuaded that if someone explained this to him, Ben Sedan would see the wisdom of this plan and take out a loan.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>福阿德认为，如果有人将这一切告诉希达，他一定会被说动，并会决定贷一笔款。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>We were struck by the contrast between Fouad’s enthusiasm and Ben Sedan’s insistence that his family did not need anything. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>福阿德的热情与希达的固执形成了鲜明的对比，这令我们颇为震惊。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Yet Ben Sedan was not at all resigned to remaining poor: He was very proud of his son, who had been trained as a nurse and worked as a paramedic in the army. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>然而，希达并不甘于一直贫穷下去：他为自己的一个儿子感到骄傲，这个儿子一直在接受护士培训，是军队里的一名护理人员。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>His son, he thought, had a real chance at a better life. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>他认为，自己的儿子一定有机会过上更美好的生活。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>So was Fouad right that Ben Sedan just needed to be led to a business plan? Or was Ben Sedan, who, after all, had been in the business of raising cows for most of his adult life, telling us something important?</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>那么，福阿德的想法是否正确，希达真的只需要得到一个商业计划指导就可以了吗？还是说，希达大半生都从事的养牛生意给我们传达了一个重要的信息？</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Muhammad Yunus, founder of the world-famous Grameen Bank, often describes the poor as natural entrepreneurs. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>穆罕默德·尤努斯创立了世界著名的格莱珉银行，他常常将穷人称为“天生的企业家”。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Combined with the late business guru C. K. Prahalad’s exhortation to businessmen to focus more on what he called the “bottom of the pyramid,” the idea of the entrepreneurial poor is helping to secure a space within the overall anti-poverty policy discourse where big business and high finance feel comfortable getting involved. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>还有，已故的商业巨头普拉哈拉德也曾劝告商人们，应更加关注其所谓的“金字塔底”。这表明，在大企业和高等财政部门的参与下，具有企业家精神的穷人有助于扶贫政策的实施。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>The traditional strategies of public action are being supplemented by private actions, often taken by some of the leaders of the corporate world (for example, Pierre Omidyar of eBay), directed at helping the poor realize their true potential as entrepreneurs.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>公共行动的传统策略已得到个体行动的补充，这些行动常常是由企业界的一些领导人做出的，主要是为了帮助穷人挖掘其企业家的潜力。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>The basic premise of Yunus’s view of the world, shared by many in the microfinance movement, is that everyone has a shot at being a successful entrepreneur. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>小额信贷运动中的很多人都同意尤努斯的世界观，认为每个人都有成为成功企业家的潜质。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>More specifically, there are two distinct reasons the poor may be particularly likely to find amazing opportunities. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>有两个明确的原因甚至可以证明，穷人或许会发现更好的机会。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>First, they haven’t been given a chance, so their ideas are probably fresher and less likely to have been tried already. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>第一，他们从未得到过一次机会，所以他们的想法可能更新颖。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Second, the market so far has mostly ignored the bottom of the pyramid. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>第二，目前市场通常忽视了“金字塔底”。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>As a result, it is argued, innovations that better the lives of the poor have to be the low-hanging fruit, and who better than the poor themselves to think of what they could be?</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>因此，他们称，创新可以改善穷人的生活，是一种可以轻松摘到的果实，而且能够想象出穷人未来的只有他们自己。</seg>

<seg>Indeed, every self-respecting MFI has a Web site with a number of stories of successful microfinance clients who took advantage of an unusual opportunity to make a fortune. </seg>

<seg>In Guntur, in Andhra Pradesh, we met a client of Spandana who had built a very successful business collecting trash and sorting it. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>在安得拉邦的贡土尔市，我们见到了一位斯潘达纳公司的客户，她通过收集垃圾并分类，成功地开创了自己的事业。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>She started as a trash collector, which is pretty much as low as you can go in the Indian social and economic hierarchy. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>一开始，她只是一个收垃圾的，处于印度经济社会阶层的最底层。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>

<seg>With her first loan from Spandana, she just paid back the loan she had from a moneylender, with its crippling interest rate. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>用来自斯潘达纳公司的第一笔贷款，她还清了从一个放债人那里借的钱（利率很高）。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>She knew that the businesses that bought the trash from her sorted it before selling it to recyclers—there would be bits of metal and tungsten from the filaments of used lightbulbs, plastics, organic matter for composting, and so forth, each of which went to a different recycler. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>她知道，从她那里买垃圾的公司会对垃圾进行分类，然后再卖给回收公司——如废旧灯泡、塑料制品、肥料有机物都含有残留的铁和钨。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>With the breathing space that the first loan bought her, she decided to do the sorting herself to make some extra money. </seg>

<seg>于是，为了多赚一些钱，她决定自己对垃圾进行分类。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>With her second loan and the savings from the first, she bought a cart, which helped her collect more trash, and because there was now more sorting to be done, she somehow managed to get her husband, who used to spend most of his time drinking, to start working with her. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>通过第二笔贷款及第一笔贷款赚的钱，她买了一辆手推车，这样她就可以收集更多的垃圾。由于要对垃圾进行分类，她让自己的丈夫也来帮忙。她的丈夫过去大多数的时间里都在喝酒，现在则开始给她帮忙。</seg>

</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Together they were making significantly more money, and after receiving the third loan, they started buying trash from others. </seg>

<seg>She was so bright, however, that the village decided to send her for a year to the local school of fashion design (whatever that meant, exactly, since everyone still wore Mao suits). </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>然而，徐爱华非常聪明，村里决定送她去当地的一家时装设计学院学习一年（不过，当时每个人都穿着中山装）。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>The idea was that she would eventually take a leadership role in the local town and village enterprise that had just been set up (these were the early years of Chinese liberalization). </seg>

<seg>So she was sent unceremoniously home, jobless.</seg>
