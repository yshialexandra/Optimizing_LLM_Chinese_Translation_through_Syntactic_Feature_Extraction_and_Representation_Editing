<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>行为科学家参与设计为满足未来使用者的需要带来了光明。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Since psychologists had expert knowledge on the ways in which people responded to light, color, and proportion, sociologists about the nature of social organization in neighborhoods, and anthropologists on buildings as symbols and artifacts, it was hoped that they would be able to apply this knowledge to the design process. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>既然心理学家在人对光、色彩和比例的反应方面有专门知识，社会学家对邻里社会组织的本质有专业研究，而人类学家对建筑作为文化的象征和人工产品有深入的研究，因此他们的参与为这些知识在设计过程中的应用带来了希望。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>This approach faltered for a number of reasons. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>然而它的发展并不稳定，其原因如下：</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>The findings collected in basic research could not be applied with any confidence. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>首先，行为科学的基础研究成果不能随心所欲地运用。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Color perception was one of the oldest topics in experimental psychology, but if an experimental psychologist were asked to specify the colors that should be used in a bus station, the answer was likely to be vague and uncertain. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>色彩知觉是实验心理学中最古老的研究课题，但如果要问一位实验心理学家，设计一座公共汽车站该选择什么颜色，回答可能是含糊而不肯定的。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Nor was research on space perception, another traditional research topic, useful for understanding orientation in buildings and neighborhoods. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>空间知觉是另一个传统研究课题，在帮助人们理解建筑和邻里的定向上用处不大。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Sociologists had done considerable research on neighborhood networks, but their findings were usually too general to assist the city planner.</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>社会学家们在邻里网络上进行了相当的研究，但他们的研究对城市规划师来说显得太概括而起不到辅助作用。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Needs analysis went through several stages in its evolution and is still changing. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>需要分析在改进的过程中经历了几个阶段，而且还在继续变化之中。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>At the outset, designers relied on needs they inferred or extrapolated from basic research studies and from theory. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>一开始设计师是靠推理，从基础研究中得来的计算和理论来了解需要。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>More recent approaches have tended to dwell less upon inferred needs and more upon direct expression of people's wants, which are obtained through surveys or by the involvement of users in the design process. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>近来的研究在方法上较少依靠推理，而倾向于获得人们愿望的直接表达（通过调研）或通过使用者参与设计来得到。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>The relationship between needs and wants is full of pitfalls for the unwary. A need is something basic, fundamental, and enduring, as in the need for shelter, sustenance, and social contact, while a want is an expressed preference, and thus is likely to be specific, transient, and more easily changed, as in the desire for a particular brand of food or clothing style. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>需要（needs）是诸如掩蔽、食物、社会接触之类的基本的、必要的、长久的东西，而愿望（wants）是表达一种选择，因此它更为具体、短暂而易变，比如喜好某个牌子的食物或衣服样式。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Human needs have traditionally been regarded as more acceptable topics of study than wants in the behavioral sciences. The investigation of preferences is considered to be a second-rate applied task, more akin to marketing than to serious scholarship. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>习惯上认为人的需要是较愿望更易接受的研究课题，而认为愿望的调查属于低一个层次的应用课题，更接近市场而非严肃的学术研究。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>This dual standard has its roots in the platonic view that appearances are deceptive and ephemeral and that the important reality lies underneath. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>这种双重的学术标准来源于柏拉图的哲学观，这种观点认为表面现象具有欺骗性、短暂性，而重要的现实总隐藏在下面。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>However in some specific eases a firm distinction between needs and wants is difficult to maintain.</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>然而在一些具体的情况下，需要和愿望是难有绝对的区分的。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Some architects and urban planners looked to the behavioral sciences not for specific bits of information that could be applied on particular projects but for general theories of human behavior that could be generalized to many settings. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>过去一些建筑师和规划师指望行为科学不仅提供可用于特殊项目的具体信息，而且希望得到普适于许多场合的关于人的一般理论。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Some designers found what they wanted to know about perception in the writings of James J. Gibson and Rudolf Arnheim; about the desire for stimulation and variety in the work of D. O. Hebb and Daniel Berlyne; and about social life within neighborhoods from Herbert Gans and Louis Wirth. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>一些设计师认为他们要理解J·吉布森和R·阿恩海姆的关于知觉的理论；要理解D·O·赫布和D·伯莱尼对人渴望刺激和差异性的研究；要理解H·甘斯和L·韦斯对邻里社会生活的研究。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>This interest in general theories remains strong today and co-exists with the desire for place-specific information.</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>时至今日，人们对一般性理论的兴趣依然很浓，同时仍保持着寻求特定场所信息的愿望。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>A mutual learning regarding what each can obtain from the other has occurred in the dialogue between designers and behavioral scientists. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>从设计师和行为科学家的对话中，能彼此了解从对方可以获得些什么。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Initially, architects complained that the social scientists' answers were too general, tentative, and often came too late to be useful. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>刚开始，建筑师常会抱怨行为科学家的回答太笼统、只是试验性的，而且来得太迟以至于错过了良机；</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Behavioral scientists criticized the architects' queries as being too specific, time-pressured, and deterministic in assuming a direct connection between building elements and behavioral patterns. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>行为科学家则批评建筑师的问题太具体、时间紧，而且在建筑元素和行为类型的联系上过于武断。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>One of the most useful contributions that social scientists have made to design was to point out that design does not alone determine behavior. Even when it strongly influences how people behave, the effects are not direct but are mediated through psycho-social factors;</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>行为科学家对设计作出的最重要的贡献是指出：单是凭设计并不能决定行为，甚至当它对人们产生很大的影响时，这个效果也并不是直接的，而是通过社会因素来协同作用的。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>for example, different people will be affected differently by the same building, depending upon whether they are alone or in a group, happy or sad, or are visiting for the first time or are accustomed to the place. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>例如，同样一幢建筑对不同的人的影响就不同，这取决于他是单个的、还是群体的，快乐的、还是忧伤的，或者，是首次莅临，还是经常光顾。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Eventually those designers who wanted to collaborate with behavioral scientists learned how to ask questions that could be answered within the time frame, methods, and data base of the social sciences, and those behavioral scientists active in the collaboration learned to produce timely and relevant reports. All this took time and patience on everyone’s part. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>那些想同行为科学家合作的设计师最终学会了怎样问一些在时间框架、方法和社会科学数据基础上可行的问题，而那些合作积极的行为科学家会学习写出及时的、相关的学术报告，所有这些对于每个人来说都需要时间和耐心。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Effective collaboration between people in different fields, especially those as distinct in training and temperament as design and behavioral science, does not come easily.</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>不同领域的研究人员之间进行有效的合作并不容易，尤其是对分别从事设计和行为科学的人来说，他们所接受的训练和自身的气质都明显不同。</seg></tuv>

<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>需要评价调查</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Another approach to needs analysis came not from basic research or from theory, but from marketing, and involved asking people what they wanted in the way of work or living space. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>需要分析的另一途径并不是靠基础研究或理论，而是来自市场，它涉及询问人们在工作和生活空间中想要些什么。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>This blurs the distinction between needs and wants, since it assumes that people’s responses will bear some relationship to both. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>既然它认为人们的回答包含了需要和愿望之间的一些关系，这也就模糊了两者的界限。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Studies of expressed preference are of interest to the social scientist and useful to industry. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>有关人们愿望的研究对产业方面也很有用，社会科学家一直对此兴趣浓厚。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>The value of such studies increases if they identify the particular properties inherent in the object on which the preference or rejection is based. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>如果他们发现某物的一种属性导致人们接纳或拒绝，则这项研究的价值就会愈来愈高。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Technically it would have been more accurate to title this chapter Wants Analysis, but I have followed the conventional practice of discussing “needs”, since, from a practical standpoint, needs are more saleable than wants. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>从技术上说本文冠名“愿望分析”会更精确些。既然从实践的角度出发，需要较愿望更易于为人们所接受，于是我仍采用讨论需要的传统实践形式。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Managers are more likely to respond positively when they are told that employees need something than when they are told that employees want it. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>当经理们被告知职员需要某物时，比告诉他们职员想要什么更易接受。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>The latter statement is likely to provoke the response, “Yes, we know they want it, but we can't a fiord to give it to them. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>后一种陈述很可能得到这样一种反应：“对，我们知道他们想要，但我们负担不起。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>However, if our workers need it then that is another matter.” </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>如果我们的工人需要这样，那就另当别论了。”</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>In some ways this is a semantics game, more akin to diplomacy than science. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>在某种程度上这是一种语言游戏，更像外交手腕而非科学本领。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Economists speak of actual behavior in the marketplace as “revealed preferences,” meaning that the behavior of people in purchasing goods and services reveals their wants and preferences. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>经济学家认为市场中的随机行为就是“意愿的展示”，亦即人们购买物品和服务的行为展示了他们的意愿和选择。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>This approach is not valid in mast designed spaces that are not “purchased” by their occupants. Nor can people’s attitudes towards the architecture or interior layout be discerned by how long they remain inside. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>这种方法在大多数设计的空间中都不成立，因为设计的空间并非为其使用者购买，人们对建筑和室内布置的态度也因他们在其中活动时间的长短而不同。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>The failure of market mechanisms to reveal preferences and levels of occupant satisfaction with designed spaces created a niche for formal techniques for gauging occupant response. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>市场方法在揭示人们对设计空间的意愿和满意度上的失败为创立量度使用者反应的正规方法提供了位置。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Most designers claim to be meeting market demands to some degree, but the distinctive feature of UNA (user needs analysis) is that it is carried out in a systematic manner. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>大多数设计师都要在某种程度上迎俣市场的要求，但使用者需要分析的特征是权一种系统的方式来进行。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>This requires the use of standardized techniques for collecting information (interviews, questionnaires, and so on) and some sampling of occupants and their activities. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>它要求采用收集信息的标准技术（访谈、问询表等等）和用户及其行为的抽样。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Without formal procedures for selecting people to be interviewed and ways of asking questions, the technique does not qualify as a UNA.</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>如无选择访问对象和提问的正规程序，这种技术就不能称为使用者需要分析（User Need Analysis，缩写为UNA）。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>It is not always safe to assume that input from potential occupants of a setting will be more relevant to the design process than input from those in similar facilities. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>在设计过程中引入潜在的作用者并不比引入使用过相似设施的人更有帮助。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>It may be that the potential occupants have never experienced a building of the same type before. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>那些潜在的使用者有可能对同样类型的建筑未曾体验过。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>For example, asking teachers and students in a traditional school building what their space and environmental needs would be in an open-plan school building with modular pods housing three grades each may turn up little useful information, unless potential occupants are given some education or experience with open-plan school buildings. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>例如，如果潜在的使用者并未接受过开放的学校空间的教育或有此种空间的体验，这时要是去问这些传统学校的师生：他们在一所由模数空间组合而成的、可容纳三个年级的、开放平面由局的学校中，有何空间需求或环境需求，他们可能提供不了什么有用的信息。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Consulting with potential occupants is always desirable when it is possible, both because of the possibility of securing useful information about the residents and their space needs，and because it will satisfy people’s desire to be consulted about changes that affect their lives.</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>尽管如此，仍应尽可能谙问一些潜在占有者，因为这既可能保证得到居民及其空间需要的有用信息，又能够满足只们希望了解影响他们生活的那些变化的愿望。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>An assumption in a needs assessment survey is that potential occupants know what they want and can communicate this to an interviewer. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>进行需要评价调查的前提是潜在作用者知道他们要什么和能够同访问人进行交流。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>In cases where people are turned off to their physical surroundings and alienated from the decision-making process, this assumption is not valid. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>在有些情况下，人们同周围环境割裂开来而无法以与到决策过程中来，这个前提就不可靠。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>

<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>大多数人在被问到城市环境改变方面的问题时都表现出犹豫不决，或只是提些建议。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>They have not given much thought to these matters. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>他们对这些事情没有太多的想法。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>There was no reason for them to be concerned since their opinions had not mattered. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>既然他们的意见无关紧要，他们也就用不阗去关心什么。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Even if they have an idea about what they want, they may not have the concepts to convey this to a designer. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>即使他们有些想法，也可能不知道怎样的设计师表达。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>This calls for some patience on the part of the interviewer in asking the right questions and in waiting for answers to come, just as listening to the speaker of another language requires special patience.</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>这就要求访问人有耐心提出恰当的问题，并等待答案。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Drawings and models can make design alternatives more tangible to the prospective occupants. People can be shown various options and asked to choose among them. </seg></tuv>
