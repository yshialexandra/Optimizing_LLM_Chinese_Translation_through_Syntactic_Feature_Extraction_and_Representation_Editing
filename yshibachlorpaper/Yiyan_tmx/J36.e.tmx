<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg> It did so not because priests claimed to govern the other world but because they were landowners, feudal lords, tithe collectors, and administrators in this one; not because the Church had no place in the new society that the people were about to institute but because it occupied the most privileged and powerful place in the old society, which was to be dashed to pieces.</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>并非因为教士们自命要治理来世的事务，而是因为他们是尘世的地主、领主、什一税征收者、行政官吏；并非因为教会不能在行将建立的新社会占有位置，而是因为在正被粉碎的旧社会中，它占据了最享有特权、最有势力的地位。</seg></tuv>

<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>As the ancient political institutions that the Revolution attacked were utterly destroyed; as the powers, influences, and classes that were particularly odious to it were progressively crushed; and - ultimate sign of their defeat - as even the hatreds they had once inspired withered and the clergy separated itself from everything that had fallen along with it, one began to see a gradual restoration of the power of the Church and a reaffirmation of its influence over the minds of men.</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>随着大革命所攻击的一切旧政治制度更彻底被摧毁，大革命所憎恶的各种权力、影响、阶级被彻底制服，一去不复返，它们所激起的仇恨，作为失败的最后标志，也日渐减退。最后，当教士从一切和他们同时垮台的东西中日益分离出来时，人们便看到，教会的力量在人们的精神中逐步恢复，并且更加巩固。</seg></tuv>
