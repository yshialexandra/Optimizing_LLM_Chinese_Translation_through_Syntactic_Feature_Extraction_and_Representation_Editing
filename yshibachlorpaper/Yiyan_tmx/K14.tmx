</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>It seemed to her a very large amount of money, and the way in which it stuffed and bulged her worn old porte-monnaie gave her a feeling of importance such as she had not enjoyed for years.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>这对她来说似乎是非常大的一笔钱，它把她破旧的小钱包塞得满满的样子给她一种好多年没有享受过的显赫的感觉。</seg>

<seg>A dollar or two should be added to the price usually paid for Janie's shoes, which would insure their lasting an appreciable time longer than they usually did. </seg>

<seg>She could elbow her way if need be; she had learned to clutch a piece of goods and hold it and stick to it with persistence and determination till her turn came to be served, no matter when it came.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>如有需要，她能推搡着挤过去；她学会了抓住一件商品，坚决地、坚持不懈地拿着不放，直到轮到她接受服务，无论什么时候轮到她。</seg>

<seg>She had swallowed a light luncheon - no! when she came to think of it, between getting the children fed and the place righted, and preparing herself for the shopping bout, she had actually forgotten to eat any luncheon at all!</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>她吞下少量的午餐——不！当她想起来时，在照顾孩子吃饭、整理房间和自己准备去大采购之间，她居然完全忘了吃午餐！</seg>

</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>She sat herself upon a revolving stool before a counter that was comparatively deserted, trying to gather strength and courage to charge through an eager multitude that was besieging breastworks of shirting and figured lawn. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>她在一个比较冷清的柜台前的旋转凳上坐下，试图积聚力量和勇气冲入急切的人群，他们正在围攻衬衫衣料和花细布的防护壁垒。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>An all-gone limp feeling had come over her and she rested her hand aimlessly upon the counter. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>一种完全失去的无力感袭上她全身，她将手漫无目的地搁在柜台上。</seg>

<seg>She looked down to see that her hand lay upon a pile of silk stockings. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>她低头看到她的手放在一堆丝袜上。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>A placard near by announced that they had been reduced in price from two dollars and fifty cents to one dollar and ninety-eight cents; and a young girl who stood behind the counter asked her if she wished to examine their line of silk hosiery. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>旁边的一个布告牌上宣布它们的价格由2美元50美分降到了1美元98美分；一个站在柜台后面的年轻女孩问她要不要看看他们的丝袜类产品。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>She smiled, just as if she had been asked to inspect a tiara of diamonds with the ultimate view of purchasing it. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>她微笑着，就好像她被请求怀着最终购买的目的检查一顶钻石王冠。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>But she went on feeling the soft, sheeny luxurious things - with both hands now, holding them up to see them glisten, and to feel them glide serpent-like through her fingers.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>但她继续触摸那柔软的、光亮的奢侈品——现在是用两只手了，把它们拿起来看它们闪耀着光，感觉它们像蛇一样在她指间滑动。</seg>

<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Two hectic blotches came suddenly into her pale cheeks. </seg>

<seg>她假装检查它们的质地，对此店员向她保证是极好的。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>"A dollar and ninety-eight cents," she mused aloud. "Well, I'll take this pair." She handed the girl a five-dollar bill and waited for her change and for her parcel. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>“1美元98美分，”她若有所思地说，“好吧，我要买这双。”她递给那个女孩一张5美元的钞票，然后等她找回的零钱和包裹。</seg>

<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>What a very small parcel it was! It seemed lost in the depths of her shabby old shopping-bag.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>多小的包裹啊！放进她破旧的购物袋的深处好像就找不着了。</seg>
</tuv>

<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Mrs. Sommers after that did not move in the direction of the bargain counter. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>在这之后萨默斯太太并没有朝廉价品柜台的方向走去。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>She took the elevator, which carried her to an upper floor into the region of the ladies' waiting-rooms. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>她乘上电梯，电梯载她到上面的一个楼层进入女士休息区。</seg>

<seg>She was not thinking at all. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>她根本就没思考。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>She seemed for the time to be taking a rest from that laborious and fatiguing function and to have abandoned herself to some mechanical impulse that directed her actions and freed her of responsibility.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>此时她仿佛是在辛苦劳累的职责中休息一下，将自己放任给某种机械的冲动，这种冲动指导了她的行动，将她从责任中解放出来。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>How good was the touch of the raw silk to her flesh! She felt like lying back in the cushioned chair and reveling for a while in the luxury of it. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>生丝轻触肌肤的感觉真好啊！她感觉好像躺在铺着软垫的椅子上，在它的奢华中陶醉了一会儿。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>She did for a little while. </seg>

<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>她确实陶醉了一小会儿。</seg>

<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Then she replaced her shoes, rolled the cotton stockings together and thrust them into her bag. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>然后她穿回她的鞋子，把棉袜卷起来塞进她的包里。</seg>

<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>The clerk could not make her out; he could not reconcile her shoes with her stockings, and she was not too easily pleased. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>店员应付不了她；他无法让她的鞋配上她的袜子，她不太容易取悦。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>She held back her skirts and turned her feet one way and her head another way as she glanced down at the polished, pointed-tipped boots. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>在她低头瞥向光亮的尖头靴子时，她提起裙子，把脚转向一边，把头转向另一边。</seg>

<seg>Her foot and ankle looked very pretty. She could not realize that they belonged to her and were a part of herself. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>她的脚和脚腕看起来非常漂亮，她没有意识到它们属于她，是她的一部分。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>She wanted an excellent and stylish fit, she told the young fellow who served her, and she did not mind the difference of a dollar or two more in the price so long as she got what she desired.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>她想要一双最好的、时髦的、合适的鞋，她告诉招待她的那个年轻人，而且她不在乎价格上多一两美元的差别，只要她得到她想要的。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>It was a long time since Mrs. Sommers had been fitted with gloves. </seg>

<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>萨默斯太太有很长时间没有戴过合适的手套了。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>On rare occasions when she had bought a pair they were always "bargains," so cheap that it would have been preposterous and unreasonable to have expected them to be fitted to the hand.</seg>

<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Now she rested her elbow on the cushion of the glove counter, and a pretty, pleasant young creature, delicate and deft of touch, drew a long-wristed "kid" over Mrs. Sommers's hand. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>现在她的胳膊肘放在手套柜台的垫子上，一个漂亮的、讨人喜欢的年轻人，动作优雅灵巧，将一只长腕的“小山羊革”拉上萨默斯太太的手。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>She smoothed it down over the wrist and buttoned it neatly, and both lost themselves for a second or two in admiring contemplation of the little symmetrical gloved hand. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>她将它平整地拉到手腕上，整洁地扣上钮扣，两个人有一两秒钟的时间沉浸在赞赏地注视那只小小的、匀称的、戴着手套的手。</seg>
