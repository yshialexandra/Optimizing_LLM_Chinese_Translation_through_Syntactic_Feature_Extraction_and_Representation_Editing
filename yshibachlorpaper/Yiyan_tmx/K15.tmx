<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>当时我们住在一个砾石坑附近。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Not a large one, hollowed out by monster machinery, just a minor pit that a farmer must have made some money from years before. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>并不大，是用怪物机挖出来的，就是那种几年前农民为了赚点钱肯定会挖的小坑。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>In fact, the pit was shallow enough to lead you to think that there might have been some other intention for it - foundations for a house, maybe, that never made it any further.</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>事实上，那坑浅得让你觉得好像它原来肯定有别的用处，比如房子的地基之类的，那种你永远都不会在它上面动下一步的地基。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>My mother was the one who insisted on calling attention to it. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>我母亲是唯一坚持要我们小心这个砾石坑的人。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>"We live by the old gravel pit out the service-station road," she'd tell people, and laugh, because she was so happy to have shed everything connected with the house, the street - the husband - with the life she'd had before.</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>“我们住在一个旧砾石坑旁边，这路上都没有加油站”，她会这么告诉别人，然后大笑，因为她摆脱了所有和房子有关的东西--街道，从前和她一起生活的丈夫，她觉得很开心。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>I barely remember that life. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>我几乎不记得那段日子了。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>That is, I remember some parts of it clearly, but without the links you need to form a proper picture. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>我是说，有些事记得很清楚，但是我没法用清晰的线索勾勒出一幅恰当的图片。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>All that I retain in my head of the house in town is the wallpaper with Teddy bears in my old room. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>关于那所镇上的房子，我记忆里留下的只有我那个旧房间里的泰迪熊墙纸。</seg></tuv>

<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>在这所新房子，或者不如说是露营车里，我和姐姐卡萝睡的是狭窄的双层帆布床，一层叠着另一层。</seg></tuv>

<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>When we first moved there, Caro talked to me a lot about our old house, trying to get me to remember this or that. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>我们刚搬到那儿时，卡萝常和我聊起老屋，企图让我记起样那样的事。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>It was when we were in bed that she talked like this, and generally the conversation ended with me failing to remember and her getting cross. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>然而有些事我都不记得了，她会因此生气，这些对话也就这样逐渐结束了。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Sometimes I thought I did remember, but out of contrariness or fear of getting things wrong I pretended not to.</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>有时我觉得我是记得的，但是为了免于纠结或是因为担心混淆事情，我干脆装作不记得了。</seg></tuv>

<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>我们搬到露营车里的时候是夏天，还有我们的狗狗布利兹。</seg></tuv>

<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>What dog wouldn't love to exchange a town street, even one with spacious lawns and big houses, for the wide-open countryside? </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>对一条狗来说，用敞朗的乡下地块换掉城镇的街道，尽管镇上有大草坪大楼房，这样一笔交易，有什么可不称心的呢？。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>She took to barking at every car that went past, as if she owned the road, and now and then she brought home a squirrel or a groundhog she'd killed. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>她对经过的每辆车都狂吠，就好像整条路都是她的，还时不时往家里叼回来一只她咬死的松鼠或土拨鼠。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>At first Caro was quite upset by this, and Neal would have a talk with her, explaining about a dog's nature and the chain of life in which some things had to eat other things.</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>起初卡萝对这些很反感，尼尔就会找她谈，跟她解释这是狗的天性，食物链里必须有一方吃另一方。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>"She gets her dog food," Caro argued, but Neal said, "Suppose she didn't? Suppose someday we all disappeared and she had to fend for herself?" </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>“她有狗粮可以吃啊”，卡萝争辩道，但是尼尔说，“但是如果她没吃呢？如果有一天我们全都不在了，她怎么喂饱自己呢？”</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>"I'm not going to," Caro said. "I'm not going to disappear, and I'm always going to look after her."  </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>“我不会的，”卡萝回道，“我不会走开的，我会永远照顾她。”</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>"You think so?" Neal said, and our mother stepped in to deflect him. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>“你确定么？”尼尔反问，这时母亲走进来把他撵走。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Neal was always ready to get on the subject of the Americans and the atomic bomb, and our mother didn't think we were ready for that yet. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>尼尔总喜欢讨论美国人和原子弹，母亲觉得对我和卡萝来说，这些话题还为时过早。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>She didn't know that when he brought it up I thought he was talking about an atomic bun. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>她并不知道每次尼尔谈起这些的时候我老觉得他在说原子弹甜面包（一种花式圆面包）。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>I knew that there was something wrong with this interpretation, but I wasn't about to ask questions and get laughed at.</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>我知道我的理解有点问题，但是我不打算提问，免得被嘲笑。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Neal was an actor. In town there was a professional summer theatre, a new thing at the time, which some people were enthusiastic about and others worried about, fearing that it would bring in riffraff. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>尼尔是个演员，镇上有个专业的夏日剧场，在那会儿是个新玩意儿，有人为之狂热，有人为之忧虑，担心剧院招来一些混混。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>My mother and father had been among those in favor, my mother more actively so, because she had more time. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>我父母都站在支持的那边，母亲尤甚，因为她更闲。</seg></tuv>
</tu>

<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>父亲做保险经纪，常出差。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>My mother had got busy with various fund-raising schemes for the theatre and donated her services as an usher. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>母亲则忙着为剧场募集自己，她自己也在那里做志愿引座员。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>She was good-looking and young enough to be mistaken for an actress. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>她那时年轻漂亮，常被误认为演员。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>She'd begun to dress like an actress, too, in shawls and long skirts and dangling necklaces. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>慢慢她也开始像女演员一样穿戴，长裙，披肩，吊坠项链。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>She'd left her hair wild and stopped wearing makeup. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>她会野性十足地披着头发，素面朝天。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Of course, I had not understood or even particularly noticed these changes at the time. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>当然，当时我无法理解她的这些改变，我甚至都没怎么注意到这些。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>My mother was my mother. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>我觉得母亲还是我的母亲。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>But no doubt Caro had. </seg></tuv>

<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>父亲也注意到了。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Though, from all that I know of his nature and his feelings for my mother, I think he may have been proud to see how good she looked in these liberating styles and how well she fit in with the theatre people. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>这些前卫造型能衬出母亲的美丽，她和剧院的人处得也很融洽，以我对父亲的个性和他对母亲的感情的了解，他应该对这些感到非常骄傲。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>When he spoke about this time later on, he said that he had always approved of the arts. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>后来谈起那段时光，父亲总是说他一直很支持艺术事业。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>I can imagine now how embarrassed my mother would have been, cringing and laughing to cover up her cringing, if he'd made this declaration in front of her theatre friends.</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>尽管当时如此，现在假如父亲当着母亲剧院的那些朋友这样宣告，她一定会觉得尴尬，拘谨地笑笑，来掩饰她的不安。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Well, then came a development that could have been foreseen and probably was, but not by my father. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>然后，就发生了预想得到的变化，可能谁都猜得到，除了父亲。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>I don't know if it happened to any of the other volunteers. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>我不知道这种事是不是也发生在其他志愿者的身上。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>I do know, though I don't remember it, that my father wept and for a whole day followed my mother around the house, not letting her out of his sight and refusing to believe her. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>尽管我不记得了，但是我确确实实知道，父亲整日哭泣，跟在母亲身后，跟着她在屋子周围转悠，不让她走出他的视线，也不愿意再相信她。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>And, instead of telling him anything to make him feel better, she told him something that made him feel worse.</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>至于我母亲，她没有跟父亲说任何让他觉得好过一点的事，却说了件让他觉得更糟的事。

<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>她告诉他，孩子是尼尔的。她确定？错不了。她一直算着日子。然后呢？</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>My father gave up weeping. He had to get back to work. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>然后父亲停止了哭泣，继续工作。</seg></tuv>
</tu>

<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>她说后来她也哭过，但是她觉得她在活着。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Maybe for the first time in her life, truly alive. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>也许是她一生中第一次，真真切切地活着。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>She felt as if she had been given a chance; she had started her life all over again. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>她觉得好像得到了另一个机会，一个让她的生活彻底重新翻牌的机会。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>She'd walked out on her silver and her china and her decorating scheme and her flower garden and even on the books in her bookcase. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>她从那个地方走了出来，留下她的银器和瓷器，她的装修方案，她的花园，甚至她书架上的书。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>She would live now, not read. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>从现在起她要开始生活，而不是阅读。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>She'd left her clothes hanging in the closet and her high-heeled shoes in their shoe trees. Her diamond ring and her wedding ring on the dresser. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>她宁愿留下挂在柜子里的衣服，鞋架上的高跟鞋，留下她梳妆台上的钻戒和婚戒，留下她抽屉里的那些丝绸晚礼服。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Her silk nightdresses in their drawer. She meant to go around naked at least some of the time in the country, as long as the weather stayed warm.</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>有时，只要天气和暖，她会故意一丝不挂地出门，在乡间走动。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>That didn't work out, because when she tried it Caro went and hid in her cot and even Neal said he wasn't crazy about the idea.</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>但那行不通，因为每次当她尝试裸走，卡萝都会躲到她的小床上，尼尔怎么解释母亲没疯都没用。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>What did he think of all this? Neal. His philosophy, as he put it later, was to welcome whatever happened. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>对这一切，尼尔是怎么想的呢？如他后来说的那样，他的人生哲学，是拥抱发生的一切事情。</seg></tuv>

<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>对于用这种口吻说话的人，我总是报之以怀疑，但是我不能说我有权利这么做。</seg></tuv>
