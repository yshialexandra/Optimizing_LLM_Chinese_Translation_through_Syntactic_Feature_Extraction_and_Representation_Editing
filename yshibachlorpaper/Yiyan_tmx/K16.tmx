<seg>杰拉德一大早醒来，面对的是异常寒冷的屋子，此时，他首先想到了他的那条蛇。</seg>

<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>The man in the pet shop at the mall had given him a long lecture before he bought the animal. "They make great pets," he'd said. </seg>

<seg>And the nice thing is they'll come to you and curl up on the couch or wherever, because of your body heat, you understand." </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>然而他们最大的好处是，它们会跟随你并盘绕在睡椅上，或者其他什么地方。</seg>

<seg>The man - he wore a name tag that read "Bozeman" and he looked to be in his forties, with a gray-flecked goatee and his hair drawn back in a patchily dyed ponytail - clearly enjoyed dispensing advice. </seg>

<seg>你知道，人的身体有热量。”店主身上穿着标有“勃兹曼”名字的外衣，看上去有四十岁左右，留着灰白的山羊胡子，头发向后梳着染过的凌乱的马尾辫子————他正享受着自己给别人提出的一系列忠告。</seg>

<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>As well he should, seeing that he was charging some four hundred dollars for a single reptile that must have been as common as a garden worm in its own country. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>同样，他当然也很清楚，为了这条极普通的爬行动物，向他人索要四百多美元，这样的爬行动物，在他们乡下如同园林里的蠕虫，随处可见。</seg>

<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>紧接着，他揉搓着报纸，把它堆积在壁炉里，可是火柴在哪儿呢？他快速地在屋子里各处寻找着，屋子里乱的一团糟，抽屉里塞满了东西，能够想象到，除了一堆碗碟高高地摞在一起，其余什么东西都没有。</seg>

<seg>他发现它蜷缩在厨房的洗碗池下面，哪里有流经水笼头和洗碗机的热水管，尽管如此，蛇还是几乎冻僵了，就像寒冷天气中，被遗忘在田园里用来浇水的软管一样，冰冷光滑，毫无生气。</seg>
