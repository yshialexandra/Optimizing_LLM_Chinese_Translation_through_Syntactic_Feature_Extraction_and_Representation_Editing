<seg>Some of the caddies were poor as sin and lived in one-room houses with a neurasthenic cow in the front yard, but Dexter Green's father owned the second best grocery-store in Black Bear--the best one was "The Hub," patronized by the wealthy people from Sherry Island--and Dexter caddied only for pocket-money.</seg>

<seg>尽管有的高尔夫球童家里一贫如洗，住在只有一个房间的屋子里，前院里有一头可怜的奶牛，但是德克斯特·格林的父亲拥有黑熊村一带第二好的杂货店。最好的杂货店叫做“中心”，谢利岛的有钱人经常光顾。德克斯特做球童只为了赚零花钱。

<seg>At these times the country gave him a feeling of profound melancholy--it offended him that the links should lie in enforced fallowness, haunted by ragged sparrows for the long season.
