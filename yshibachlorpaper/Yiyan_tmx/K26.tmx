<seg>Thirty-five years after my father left Ethiopia, he died in a room in a boarding house in Peoria, Illinois, that came with a partial view of the river. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>父亲是在离开埃塞俄比亚35年后去世的，就在位于伊利诺伊州皮奥里亚（Peoria）的一座公寓中他那间可览湖光的房间里。</seg>

<seg>We had never spoken much during his lifetime, but, on a warm October morning in New York shortly after he died, I found myself having a conversation with him as I walked north on Amsterdam Avenue, toward the high school where for the past three years I had been teaching a course in Early American literature to privileged freshmen.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>他在世的时候，我们父子之间言谈不多，然而，在他去世不久后，在10月的纽约，一个暖意融融的清晨，我和过去三年一样，沿着阿姆斯特丹大街向北，向着我教授新生们《早期美国文学》的高中走去。在这一段路途中，我发现自己开始和父亲“交谈”起来。</seg>

<seg>"That's the Academy right there," I told him. "You can see the top of the bell tower through the trees. </seg>

<seg>I stole it from a short story by Kafka that I read in college - a monkey who's been trained to talk gives a speech to an academy. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>卡夫卡（Kafka）的一部短篇小说里——讲的是一只被训练得能够说话的猴子向一所学院做演讲的故事。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>I used to wonder if that was how my students and the other teachers, even with all their liberal, cultured learning, saw me - as a monkey trying to teach their language back to them. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>过去我常常有这样的感觉，觉得我的学生们和学校的其他老师，这些受过良好教育的人也是如此看待我的——一只训练有素的猴子反过来向人们教授他们自己的语言。</seg>

<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Do you remember how you spoke? I hated it. </seg>

<seg>您还记得您的说话方式么？那可让我讨厌极了。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>You used those short, broken sentences that sounded as if you were spitting out the words, as if you had just learned them but already despised them, even the simplest ones. 'Take this.' 'Don't touch.' 'Leave now.' "</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>您总是用那些支离破碎的短句，您说话就像您把那些词儿像吐痰一样吐出来，哪怕是最简单的句子也是如此，让人觉得您虽然并不精于此却已对这些字眼厌恶非常了。即便是‘拿上这个。’、‘别碰它。’、‘走吧。’这样的短句子也不例外。”</seg>

<seg>I arrived in my classroom ten minutes before the bell rang, just as the first of my students trickled in. They were the smartest, and took their seats near the center. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>我在上课铃响前10分钟跨进了教室，那时我的学生中到校最早的一批也正缓缓走进教室。这个时间点来的都是这个班里的佼佼者，他们选了靠近教室中央的位置坐下。</seg>

<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>The rest arrived in no discernible order, but I noticed that all of them, smart and stupid alike, seemed hardly to talk, or, if they talked, it was only in whispers. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>余下的学生三三两两地走进教室，但我意识到他们所有人，无论聪明愚笨，几乎都不怎么说话，即便说话，也都是在轻声地交头接耳。</seg>

</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Most said hello as they entered, but their voices were more hesitant than usual, as if they weren't sure that it was really me they were addressing.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>他们中的大多数人在进教室时都喊了“报告”，较之以往，我从他们的声音中听出了一丝犹豫，这感觉就像他们在确认我是否是他们平时问候的那个人一样。</seg>

</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>"I'm sorry for having missed class the other day," I began, and because I felt obliged to explain my absence I told them the truth. </seg>

<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>和“父亲”的“交谈”就那样结束了，我觉得有些意犹未尽。</seg>
</tuv>

<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>So I continued. "He was sixty-seven years old when he died. </seg>

<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>所以我续道，“我父亲去世时67岁。</seg>

<seg>He was born in a small village in northern Ethiopia. </seg>

</tu>
<tu>

<seg>And while I could have ended there I had no desire to. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>依常理，有关我父亲的话说到这个份上就该打住了，但我本人并不这么想。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>I needed a history more complete than the strangled bits that he had owned and passed on to me - a short, brutal tale of having been trapped as a stowaway on a ship. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>我想对那段往事有一个透彻的了解，而非父亲告诉我的那些难以消化的只言片语——一段简短、惨淡有关我父亲偷渡往美国的故事。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>So I continued with my father's story, knowing that I could make up the missing details as I went.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>所以我继续讲述父亲的故事，在讲述的过程中，我发现自己居然能够把以往缺失的部分补完，虽然有我自己杜撰的成分。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>He was an engineer before he left Ethiopia, I told my students, but after spending several months in prison for attending a political rally banned by the government he was reduced to nothing. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>我告诉我的学生们，在离开埃塞俄比亚之前，父亲是个工程师，但因为参加一个反政府游行，被拘押数月后失去了工作。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>He knew that if he returned home he would eventually be arrested again, and that this time he wouldn't survive, so he took what little he had left and followed a group of men who told him that they were heading to Sudan, because it was the only way out.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>他明白如果自己折回家里，最终还是免不了要再次入狱，这次恐怕就很难全身而退了，别无选择，他带上自己微薄的积蓄，和他结识的一帮人一起前往苏丹。</seg>

</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>For one week he walked west. </seg>

</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>一番周折之后，他搭上了一辆满载迁往边境地带的逃难者的小货车。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Every few hours, they passed a village, each one a cluster of thatch-roofed huts with a dirt road carved down the middle, where children eagerly waved as the refugees passed, as if the simple fact that they were travelling in a truck meant they were off to someplace better.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>每隔数小时，他们就会经过一个村庄，这些村子破败不已，一条穿村而过的土路边满是茅草房，每当他们经过时，道旁总会有孩子热切地挥手，这感觉就像这些车上的人能够去一个好些的地方一样。</seg>

<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>When he finally arrived at the port town in Sudan, he had already lost a dozen pounds. </seg>

<seg>When he opened his eyes and looked up he saw three men standing nearby, their backs all slightly turned to him, so that he could see only their long white djellabahs, dirty but not nearly as filthy as some of the others that he had recently seen. </seg>
