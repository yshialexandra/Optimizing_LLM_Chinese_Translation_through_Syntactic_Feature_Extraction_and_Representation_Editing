<seg>雕塑家的葬礼</seg>
</tuv>

<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>A group of the townspeople stood on the station siding of a little Kansas town, awaiting the coming of the night train, which was already twenty minutes overdue. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>堪萨斯州一座小城的车站里，一群市民站在月台上等候着夜班车的到来，那趟车已经晚点二十分钟了。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>The snow had fallen thick over everything; in the pale starlight the line of bluffs across the wide, white meadows south of the town made soft, smoke- colored curves against the clear sky. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>四周覆盖着厚厚的积雪，淡淡的月光下，小城南面宽广辽阔、白雪皑皑的草地外，陡峭的山崖在明净的夜空勾描出一道柔和的灰黑色曲线。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>The men on the siding stood first on one foot and then on the other, their hands thrust deep into their trousers pockets, their overcoats open, their shoulders screwed up with the cold; and they glanced from time to time toward the southeast, where the railroad track wound along the river shore. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>月台上那些男人，敞着外套，缩着脖子，双手深深地插进裤兜，不住地左右跺脚，不时地朝铁轨沿着河岸蜿蜒前伸的东南方探望。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>They conversed in low tones and moved about restlessly, seeming uncertain as to what was expected of them. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>他们低声交谈着，惶惶不安地四处走动，仿佛不明白要他们来做什么事儿似的。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>There was but one of the company who looked as though he knew exactly why he was there; and he kept conspicuously apart; walking to the far end of the platform, returning to the station door, then pacing up the track again, his chin sunk in the high collar of his overcoat, his burly shoulders drooping forward, his gait heavy and dogged. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>然而，有一个人看起来好像十分清楚来这儿的目的；他索然离群，下巴缩进外套的高领，壮实的双肩颓然下垂，步态沉重而又顽强，在站口与月台尽头之间来来回回地踱步。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Presently he was approached by a tall, spare, grizzled man clad in a faded Grand Army suit, who shuffled out from the group and advanced with a certain deference, craning his neck forward until his back made the angle of a jackknife three-quarters open.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>不一会儿，一个头发灰白，身穿褪色的国民军制服的瘦高个男人，伸出长长的脖子，像一把展开了四分之三的折刀，带着几分敬重的神情，从人群中走过来。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>"I reckon she's agoin' to be pretty late ag'in tonight, Jim," he remarked in a squeaky falsetto. "S'pose it's the snow?" </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>“吉姆，我估摸着这趟车今夜又要晚点很久。”他尖声尖气地说，“雪落得忒大了？”</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>"I don't know," responded the other man with a shade of annoyance, speaking from out an astonishing cataract of red beard that grew fiercely and thickly in all directions.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>“不知道。”对方从一大蓬又硬又密、拳曲松乱的胡须下冲出一句，话音里透着几分怒气。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>The spare man shifted the quill toothpick he was chewing to the other side of his mouth. "It ain't likely that anybody from the East will come with the corpse, I s'pose," he went on reflectively.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>瘦高个男子把嘴里嚼着的羽毛梗牙签卷到嘴的另一角，若有所思地说道：“东边儿怕莫是没有人过来送尸吧。”</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>"I don't know," responded the other, more curtly than before.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>“不知道。”对方的回答比先前更粗鲁了。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>"It's too bad he didn't belong to some lodge or other. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>“可惜他不是个村夫什么的。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>I like an order funeral myself. They seem more appropriate for people of some reputation," the spare man continued, with an ingratiating concession in his shrill voice, as he carefully placed his toothpick in his vest pocket. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>我自己就喜欢花钱安排的葬礼，那才不失名人的体面。”瘦高个继续说道，小心翼翼地把牙签放进背心口袋，尖细的嗓音里流露出讨好让步的语气。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>He always carried the flag at the G. A. R. funerals in the town.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>城里举行军礼葬，他总是扛大旗。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>The heavy man turned on his heel, without replying, and walked up the siding. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>神色凝重的男子不作回答，屁股一扭，朝月台走过去。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>The spare man shuffled back to the uneasy group. "Jim's ez full ez a tick, ez ushel," he commented commiseratingly.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>瘦高男子又拖着脚步回到那群惶惶不安的人群里，惋惜地评说道：”跟往常一样，吉姆又喝高了。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Just then a distant whistle sounded, and there was a shuffling of feet on the platform. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>正值此时，远方传来汽笛的鸣叫，月台上紧接着响起一阵嘈杂的脚步声。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>A number of lanky boys of all ages appeared as suddenly and slimily as eels wakened by the crack of thunder; some came from the waiting room, where they had been warming themselves by the red stove, or half-asleep on the slat benches; others uncoiled themselves from baggage trucks or slid out of express wagons. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>一群老老少少，高高瘦瘦的男人，像群炸雷惊醒的鳝鱼，突然窜到月台上。有几个在红彤彤的炉火边取暖，或者在长条凳上半睡半醒的，从候车室里钻出来；另几个卷曲身子，抱团驱寒的则从行李车和快运货车里冒出来。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Two clambered down from the driver's seat of a hearse that stood backed up against the siding. They straightened their stooping shoulders and lifted their heads, and a flash of momentary animation kindled their dull eyes at that cold, vibrant scream, the world-wide call for men. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>有两个人从停靠在月台边的灵车的驾驶座上爬下来，挺了挺胸，抬起头，那凛冽、颤抖的嘶叫——响彻世界的召唤声，骤然间在他们漠漠无神的眼睛里点亮了一道转瞬即逝的活泼的闪光。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>It stirred them like the note of a trumpet; just as it had often stirred the man who was coming home tonight, in his boyhood.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>汽笛声，像喇叭里吹出的音符，使他们激动；就像它使今晚回家的那个男人在童年时代常常激动地那样。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>The night express shot, red as a rocket, from out the eastward marsh lands and wound along the river shore under the long lines of shivering poplars that sentineled the meadows, the escaping steam hanging in gray masses against the pale sky and blotting out the Milky Way. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>那趟夜间快车像一支红色的火箭，冲出东边的洼地，在一行行长长的守卫在草地上瑟瑟发抖的白杨树下，沿着河岸蜿蜒前行。一团团飘散的灰白色蒸汽挂在苍白的夜空，淹没了银河。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>In a moment the red glare from the headlight streamed up the snow-covered track before the siding and glittered on the wet, black rails. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>不一会儿，车头耀眼的红灯照射在月台前白雪覆盖的铁路，湿漉漉、黑幽幽的钢轨闪闪发亮。</seg>

</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>The burly man with the disheveled red beard walked swiftly up the platform toward the approaching train, uncovering his head as he went. </seg>

<seg>那个身材魁梧、胡须蓬乱的男人，迎着进站的火车走去，一边走一边摘下头上的帽子。</seg>

<seg>The group of men behind him hesitated, glanced questioningly at one another, and awkwardly followed his example. </seg>

<seg>The train stopped, and the crowd shuffled up to the express car just as the door was thrown open, the spare man in the G. A. B. suit thrusting his head forward with curiosity. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>列车停站，快车门刚一掀开，那群人便拥上前去，穿国民军制服的瘦高个好奇地探着头。</seg>

<seg>There was a kind of power about her face--a kind of brutal handsomeness, even, but it was scarred and furrowed by violence, and so colored and coarsened by fiercer passions that grief seemed never to have laid a gentle finger there. </seg>

<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>她脸上有一种力量——一种粗犷的俊俏；即便如此，那俊俏却被狂野刻上了一道道疤痕和皱纹，被更加狂暴的情绪渲染得如此腥红，扭曲得如此粗糙，仿佛悲伤从来没有在她的脸上留过情面。</seg>

<seg>The long nose was distended and knobbed at the end, and there were deep lines on either side of it; her heavy, black brows almost met across her forehead; her teeth were large and square and set far apart--teeth that could tear. </seg>

<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">

<seg>The daughter--the tall, rawboned woman in crepe, with a mourning comb in her hair which curiously lengthened her long face sat stiffly upon the sofa, her hands, conspicuous for their large knuckles, folded in her lap, her mouth and eyes drawn down, solemnly awaiting the opening of the coffin. </seg>
