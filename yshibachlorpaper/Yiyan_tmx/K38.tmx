<seg>Every now and then, I run around the countryside, delivering the warm, dark slop that farmers use to supplement the fodder for their cattle, blending the treacle with barley to make a sweet malty mix that the beasts can't get enough of. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>我不时地跑到乡下去，运送冒着热气的黑黑的糖浆，农民们可以把它掺进草料里，和大麦搅拌在一起，制成甜甜的、醇香的麦芽混合饲料喂牲畜，它们吃的可带劲呢，总也吃不够！我喜欢到农场上去，在中午时分，享受这里的宁静和寂寞。</seg>

<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>I like going out on the farms, all quiet and lonely in the middle of the day; I like talking to the farmers and listening to their stories - men who have never been anywhere in all their born years save these hundred acres of ground, grown men haunted by their own holdings. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>喜欢和农民聊天，听他们讲五花八门的故事，——那些一辈子也没有去过任何地方的男人，只积攒下数百亩田地的故事，那些被自己的土地所纠缠、羁绊的大老爷们的故事。</seg>

<seg>To be honest, I like hauling treacle more than anything else. </seg>

<seg>There are times when it's so thick and dark and solid you could walk on it, and we have to work hard to get it pumped out and into the big tanks, which are usually so old and creaky that you think they won't hold. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>有些时候，它黏糊糊的，黑黑的，凝固在一起，坚实得上面能行人，我们必须使出浑身解数，把它抽出来，再注入一个个大罐，这些陈旧的大罐通常发出嘎吱吱的响声，让人以为它们快要裂开了。</seg>

</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>On a really warm day, one of the pipes, or maybe the wall of the tank, will give way, and there will be treacle everywhere: treacle and the smell of treacle that makes you dizzy, it's so sweet and strong.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>遇到一个暖融融的日子，其中的某根管子，或罐壁，会发生泄漏，糖浆流的到处都是：糖浆和蜜糖的气味让人眩晕，因为实在是太甜了、气味太浓了。</seg>

<seg>It was just that we'd always been private people, in our different ways. </seg>

<seg>只不过我们两人性情孤僻、个性独立，各人的处事方式也不同。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>

<seg>That was probably what made it possible for us to stay together after Caroline left. We knew how to keep ourselves to ourselves, a skill we had perfected through the years without even knowing how completely we had mastered it.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>不过，我们知道如何彼此保持一定距离，井水不犯河水，有想法不跟对方说，自己闷在心里，多年来这一技巧我们运用娴熟、驾驭自如，甚至自己也不知道是如何练就的。或许这就是在卡罗琳离开之后我们还不至于分手的缘故吧。</seg>

<seg>While Sall made herself busy in the kitchen, I would sit in the dining room with the paper spread out on the table, or I would listen to the radio, staring out at the garden and fiddling with the dials to get a better signal. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>萨勒在厨房里忙着做饭，我便坐在餐厅里，在餐桌上摊开报纸，读读报，要么听听收音机，两眼望着窗外的花园，旋转着调谐钮以使信号更好些。</seg>

<seg>It had been a good day, but I knew I wasn't supposed to overdo it, so I was happy enough saying my goodbyes to Ben Walsh, who used to run Jacob's Well with his dad, and keeps it going himself now, his wife gone, no kids, both his parents dead. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>那天，天气不错，但我知道我不能工作得太晚，所以我十分愉快地向本沃尔什道了声再见。原先他和他的父亲共同经营雅各布威尔农场，现如今他的父母都不在人世了，农场全靠他一个人打理，他的妻子也过世了，没给他留下一男半女。</seg>

<seg>雨是在卡车驶进那片树林几百码，离我家还有三十英里时下起来的，雨雪交加，可能一会儿会变成雪，也有可能云消雾散。天已经完全黑了下来，我亮着车灯，驶进树林，从一片山毛榉树下经过时，仿佛进入了一个小剧场，只见黑暗中灯光闪烁、忽隐忽现，整片树林黑魆魆的，寂静无声，宛若剧场里的背景。</seg>

<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>天已经黑透了，还下着雨，我仔细打量她一番，不禁怔住了，只见她戴着假发，乱蓬蓬的，脸上伤痕累累，布满瘀伤，裙裾下方，右腿上有块暗斑，很可能是血迹。</seg>

<seg>Some nights, coming home in the dark, reeling off the narrow roads that ran to Perth or St. Andrews, remembering the way by my own landmarks - the hedges and drystone dykes and the spaces between them that other people didn't even notice, tight angles of holly or lamplight as I came through a town - I would realize, with a pleasant rush of surprise, that I was fond of myself as I was, fond of my life, and yet, at the same time, not that worried about having to let it go. </seg>
