<seg>IN THE EARLY 1960s my parents ran a service station about 60 miles west of Fort Worth. </seg>

<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>20世纪60年代初，我父母在沃思堡市（Fort Worth）以西约60英里的地方开了一个加油站。</seg>

<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>The gas station was in the middle of the country, along a reddish, gravelly, rutted road, on the way to nowhere. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>这个加油站位于所在村子的中心，沿边是一条浅红色的碎石公路，路面留有凹凸不平的车辙，不知通向何方。</seg>

<seg>Pumping gas was a hard way to make a living, and my father was never shy about reminding me about this. </seg>

<seg>When I was 10 years old one of my father's customers had caught a big catfish on a weekend trip to the Colorado River. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>我10岁那年，父亲的一位顾客周末在科罗拉多河（the Colorado River）度假时捉到了一条大鲶鱼。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>It weighed 86 pounds, a swollen, gasping, grotesque netherworld creature pulled writhing and fighting up into the bright, hot, dusty world above.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>这条鱼有86磅重，鼓胀鼓胀的、扑哧作响，它是地下世界的生物，被拖上光明炎热、满是尘土的地面时不停地翻腾、拼命挣扎。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>The man had brought the fish, wrapped in wet burlap, all the way out to my father's service station in the back of his car. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>那位男顾客用湿麻袋裹起鱼，放在车尾，一路驶向我爸的加油站，把鱼带了过来。</seg>

<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>We were to have a big barbecue that weekend, and I was given the job of keeping the fish watered and alive until the time came to kill and cook it.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>那个周末我们打算吃烧烤大餐，我的任务是不停地给鱼加水，让它在被杀来做菜之前还活蹦乱跳。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>All day long that Friday - in late August, school had not yet started - I knelt beside the gasping fish and kept it hosed down with a trickle of cool water, giving the fish life one silver gasp at a time, keeping its gills and its slick gray skin wet: the steady trickling of that hose, and nothing else, helping it stay alive. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>那是八月底的一个星期五，学校还没有开学，我成天跪在那条扑哧的鱼旁，不停地用软管往它身上浇冷水，让它暂时死不了，仍然在闪着银光的水流下扑哧作响，让它的鱼鳃、灰色滑溜的鱼皮保持湿润：其实也没别的什么事，不过是让软管持续不断地放出细细流水，保持鱼鲜活而已。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>We had no tub large enough to hold the fish, and so I squatted beside it in the dust, resting on my heels, and studied it as I moved the silver stream of water up and down its back.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>我们的盆子不够大，装不下那条鱼，于是我就踮着脚跟，蹲在地上，守在鱼旁看着，把闪着银光的水流往鱼脊上来回浇洒。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>The fish, in turn, studied me with its round, obsidian eyes, which had a gold lining to their perimeter, like pyrite. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>那条鱼反过来也用它那圆圆的黑曜石般的眼睛打量着我，它的眼圈是金黄色的，就像黄铁矿的颜色。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>The fish panted and watched me while the heat built all around us, rising steadily through the day from the fields, giving birth in the summer-blue sky to towering white cumulus clouds. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>那条鱼边盯着我边扑哧扑哧喷气，当时我被热气包围着，热气从田间蒸腾，从早到晚都不曾减弱，夏日的蓝天也因此积聚了一层层厚厚的白云。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>I grew dizzy in the heat, and from the strange combination of the unblinking monotony and utter fascination of my task, until the trickling from my hose seemed to be inflating those clouds - I seemed to be watering those clouds as one would water a garden. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>在炎炎夏日里，我做的事就是一眼都不眨地盯着，搞得头晕眼花，但不可思议的是，我对此又非常着迷，后来我用软管浇出涓涓细流时，觉得自己仿佛在让云朵膨胀，就像别人浇灌花园一样在浇灌云朵。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Do you ever think that those days were different - that we had more time for such thoughts, that time had not yet been corrupted? I am speaking less of childhood than of the general nature of the world we are living in. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>你是否曾想到那些与众不同的日子，那些有更多时间可以这样想象的日子，那些依旧纯洁的时光？我常常提及我们现世中的常见事物，而很少提及童年生活。</seg>

<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>If you are the age I am now - mid-50s - then maybe you know what I mean.</seg>

<seg>如果你和我一样现在已经55岁了，你可能就会明白我的意思。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>The water pooled and spread across the gravel parking lot before running in wandering rivulets out into the field beyond, where bright butterflies swarmed and fluttered, dabbing at the mud I was making.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>水先积成一滩，然后向碎石铺就的停车场散去，最后形成几条弯弯的细流，一直流向远处的田里。田间的蝴蝶成群结对、欢快地飞来飞去，轻轻地落在我堆的泥土上。</seg>

<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Throughout the afternoon, some of the adults who were showing up wandered over to examine the monstrosity. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>整个下午都有一些小青年过来围着这条大得吓人的东西转。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Among them was an older boy, Jack, a 15-year-old who had been kicked out of school the year before for fighting. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>他们当中有个年纪较大的，叫杰克，15岁了，头一年因为打架被踢出了校门。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Jack waited until no adults were around and then came by and said that he wanted the fish, that it was his father's - that his father had been the one who had caught it - and that he would give me five dollars if I would let him have it.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>杰克等那些小青年都离开后，走了过来，向我要这条鱼，他说这条鱼是他爸爸的，是他爸爸抓到这条鱼的，如果我把鱼给他，他愿意付5美元。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>"No," I said, "my father told me to take care of it."</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>“不，”我说，“我爸跟我说了，要我看好它。”</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Jack had me figured straightaway for a Goody Two-Shoes. </seg>

<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>杰克直白地说我是一个伪君子。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>"They're just going to kill it," he said. </seg>

<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>骗你不是人。”</seg>

</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">

<seg>他还说，“把它给我，否则我揍你。”</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>As if intuiting or otherwise discerning trouble - though trouble followed Jack, and realizing that did not require much prescience - my father appeared from around the corner, and asked us how everything was going. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>我爸或许是因为直觉，或许是他看到杰克在找我麻烦，这不用多想就能知道，他从角落里走了出来，问我一切可好。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Jack, scowling but saying nothing, tipped his cap at the fish but not at my father or me, and walked away.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>杰克皱着眉头，一声不吭，用他戴的帽子指了指鱼，但没有指我和爸爸，就走开了。</seg>

<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>“没什么”，我说，“他只是来看看鱼。”</seg>

</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">

<seg>“好的”，我回答说。</seg>

<seg>Later in the evening, before dark, but only barely, a woman I thought was probably Jack's mother - I had seen her talking to him - came walking over and crouched beside me. </seg>

<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
