</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Milkmen had long ago ceased to exist in Beijing, milk being sold abundantly in stores now; still, approaching ninety, she was snatched from time to time by the old fear that a neighbor or a passerby would swipe their two rationed bottles. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>送奶工在北京早已经不存在了，现在牛奶都放在商店里卖。但是她母亲快要九十岁了，她不时害怕邻居或过路人会拿走他们家的两个奶瓶，她记得她们家有两次因为丢了奶瓶被罚钱。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>

<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>母亲要范老师到客厅里面去，她坐在一张扶手椅上，这是他父亲去世前喜欢坐的地方。</seg></tuv>

<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>他站在母亲身前拍拍她放在膝上的手，要她放心。</seg></tuv>

<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>“我热一点牛奶好吗？”他问，尽管他看到母亲已经像往常一样陷入沉思中，这种沉思有时会让她片刻清醒起来。</seg></tuv>

<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>有时他设法哄劝她像小孩学步一样走路，这样可以锻炼她萎缩的肌肉。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>

<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>范老师退回到书房里，这里是父亲在世时的领地。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>His mother had long ago stopped visiting this room, so Teacher Fei was the one who took care of the books on the shelves, airing the yellowing pages twice a year on the balcony, but inevitably some of the books had become too old to rescue, making way for the fashion magazines that Teacher Fei now purchased.</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>母亲早就不再进入这间房间，所以是范老师来维护书架上的书籍，每年两次把那些发黄的书拿到阳台上吹吹风。有些书太旧了不能再用，就给范老师买来的时尚杂志让了路。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>The black-clad girl taunted him from the magazine lying open on the floor. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>那本打开着躺在地板上的时尚杂志，上面的黑衣女孩激怒了范老师。</seg></tuv>

<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>他把她捡起来小心翼翼地放在书桌上，然后在抽屉里找墨水瓶。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Much of the ink in the bottle had evaporated from lack of use, and few of the brushes in the bamboo container were in good shape now. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>由于不太常用大部分墨水已经蒸发，竹筒里的几支毛笔却还保存得很好。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Still, with a fine brush pen and just enough ink on the tip, he was able to sketch a scorpion in the margin of the page, its pincers stabbing toward the girl's eyes. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>他用一支细毛笔蘸了墨水，在杂志的纸边上画了一只蝎子，蝎子的螯直刺女孩的眼睛。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>It had been six years since he retired as an art teacher, nearly forty since he last painted out of free will. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>他从美术教师的位置上退休已经有六年，而离他上一次自由自在的泼墨挥毫，则已经有四十年了。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Teacher Fei looked at the drawing. His hand was far from a shaking old man's. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>范老师看着自己的画作，他的手还没有像老人那样颤抖。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>He could have made the scorpion an arthropod version of the girl, but such an act would have been beneath his standards. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>他本来可以把女孩画成蝎子，但是这种把戏不是范老师的作为。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Teacher Fei had never cursed at a woman, either in words or in any other form of expression, and he certainly did not want to begin with a young girl.</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>范老师从来不辱骂妇女，无论是用言语或其它方式，他当然不会为这么一个小女孩破了例。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Later, when Mrs. Luo, a neighbor in her late forties who had been laid off by the local electronics factory, came to sit with Teacher Fei's mother, he went to a nearby Internet cafe. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>后来，当邻居罗太太过来陪他母亲，他就去了附近网吧。罗太太不到五十岁，是本地电子厂的下岗工人。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>It was a little after two, a slow time for the business, and the manager was dozing off in the warm sunshine. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>这时刚过两点，网吧里生意很清淡，老板在太阳下打着瞌睡。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>A few middle-school students, not much older than twelve or thirteen, were gathered around a computer, talking in tones of hushed excitement, periodically breaking into giggles. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>有几个十二三岁的中学生挤在一台电脑前，用压低了的声音兴奋地说着话，不时发出吃吃的笑声。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Teacher Fei knew these types of kids. They pooled their pocket money in order to spend a few truant hours in a chat room, impersonating people much older than themselves and carrying on affairs with other human beings who could be equally fraudulent. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>范老师很了解这些孩子，他们把钱存起来花在聊天室里，装成大人和别人谈恋爱，那些别人当然也可能是假的。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>In his school days, Teacher Fei had skipped his share of classes to frolic with friends in the spring meadow or to take long walks in the autumn woods, and he wondered if, in fifty years, the children around the computer would have to base their nostalgia on a fabricated world that existed only in a machine. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>范老师上学的时候会逃课和朋友们出去春游，或者在秋天到树林里去远足。他想，五十年后，当电脑边的那些孩子怀旧的时候，他们能想起的只有电脑里的虚拟世界。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>But who could blame them for paying little attention to the beautiful April afternoon? </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>但是谁能责备他们不去关心美丽的春天下午呢？</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Teacher Fei had originally hired Mrs. Luo for an hour a day so that he could take a walk; ever since he had discovered the Internet, Mrs. Luo's hours had been increased. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>范老师起先花钱雇罗太太每天陪母亲一个小时，这样他可以到外面散步。自从他学会了上网以后，罗太太的工时增加了。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Most days now she spent three hours in the afternoon taking care of Teacher Fei's mother and cooking a meal for both of them. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>大多数日子罗太太下午在范老师家照顾母亲三个小时，还为他们两人做一顿饭。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>The manager of the Internet cafe had once suggested that Teacher Fei purchase a computer of his own; the man had also volunteered to set it up, saying that he would be happy to see a good customer save money, even if it meant that he would lose some business. </seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>网吧老板曾建议范老师自己买一台电脑，还自告奋勇地帮范老师装机，说他看见老顾客能省钱很高兴，尽管他要少做一些生意。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Teacher Fei had rejected the generous offer - despite his mother's increasing loss of her grip on reality, he could not bring himself to perform any act of dishonesty in her presence.</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>范老师回绝了老板的慷慨，尽管母亲越来越不能把握现实，只要母亲在，他就不能对她有所欺瞒。</seg></tuv>
