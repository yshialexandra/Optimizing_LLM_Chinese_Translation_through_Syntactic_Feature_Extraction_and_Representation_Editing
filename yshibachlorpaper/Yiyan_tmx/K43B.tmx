<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>I would get up every morning at the orphanage, make my bed just like the little soldier that I had become and then I would get into one of the two straight lines and march to breakfast with the other twenty or thirty boys who also lived in my dormitory.</seg></tuv>

<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>So I prayed for them and then I put them in an old torn up shoe box and I buried them in the bottom of the fort that I had built in the ground, out by the large bamboos, near the blackberry bushes.</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>所以我为它们祈祷，然后把它们放进一个破旧的鞋盒里，埋在我在地上建的城堡底部，在大竹林的外面，靠近黑莓丛。</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Every year when the butterflies would return to the orphanage and try to land on me I would try and shoo them away because they did not know that the orphanage was a bad place to live and a very bad place to die.</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>每年当蝴蝶返回孤儿院、想要落在我身上时，我都要试着发出嘘声把它们赶走，因为它们不知道孤儿院不是一个适合居住的地方，更不是一个适合死的地方。</seg></tuv>
