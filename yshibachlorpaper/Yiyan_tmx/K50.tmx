<seg>Beverly and I were second graders at New Carew Street School and we both hated recess. </seg>

<seg>我是纽卡鲁街小学二年级的学生，我有个同学，叫贝弗莉。</seg>

<seg>She hated recess and she cried the whole time and nobody knew why, so everybody made fun of her. </seg>

<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>我们俩都讨厌课后兴趣小组时间，她为了这事儿总是哭，别人不知道她为什么哭，所以都在笑话她。</seg>

<seg>I hated recess because it wasn't really school and we weren't learning anything. It was a waste of time. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>我讨厌兴趣小组是因为我觉得这不是正经的学校课程，我们不能学到任何知识，还得浪费时间。</seg>

<seg>I knew Beverly only by name and by what I could tell from spying on her. </seg>

<seg>我对贝弗莉的了解很少，我只知道她的名字，还有我偶尔偷偷观察发现的一些事。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Her last name was LaPlante, which was strange and therefore wrong, and she was known for being a crybaby. </seg>

<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>她的姓氏是拉普朗特，这个姓氏很奇怪，也许是拼写错误。她还是出了名的爱哭鬼。</seg>

<seg>贝弗莉长的也不漂亮，还老是哭，哭得我都害怕，所以我从来都不敢跟她说话。</seg>

<seg>Besides, I didn't want anybody to think I was her friend. She didn't belong. </seg>

<seg>此外，我也不想让任何人误会我是她的朋友，她没有这个资格。</seg>

<seg>好消息是，冬季的某天，贝弗莉·拉普朗特消失了。</seg>

<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>我想，噢，太好了，她本来就不该在这儿，现在她终于走了。</seg>

</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>I wondered if she was crying in her new place, wherever that was. </seg>

<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>说不定这会儿她正在新学校哭呢。</seg>

</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>I wondered how she had managed to disappear or if it was something that her mother and father had done to her. </seg>

<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>不过她为什么决定要走呢？是她爸妈决定的吗？</seg>

<seg>Second grade came to a dull close without any further thought about Beverly LaPlante.</seg>

<seg>二年级就这样平淡无波地过去了，那天之后，我再也没有好好想过贝弗莉·拉普朗特的事儿。</seg>

<seg>Third grade started with a bang. We had a new teacher, Miss Connolly, who loved me because I was smart and clean, and I loved her back because she was beautiful. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>三年级开始的时候，发生了一件大事——我们有了一个新老师，康诺丽小姐。她很喜欢我，因为我聪明整洁，而我也很喜欢她，因为她很漂亮。</seg>

<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>At dinner one night, my mother said to my father, "She's very nice, but, dear God, those teeth!"</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>有一天晚餐的时候，我妈妈对我爸爸说：“康诺丽小姐很棒，但是，老天啊，看看她的那些牙！”</seg>

<seg>"What's with her teeth?" my father said.</seg>

<seg>“她的牙？怎么了？”爸爸问。</seg>

</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>“她那口龅牙活像一匹马。”</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>It was only conversation, but it wasn't nice to Miss Connolly, so I hated them both until I went to bed.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>这只是饭桌上一段平凡的插曲，但我觉得这些话冒犯了康诺丽小姐，所以我直到上床的时候还觉得很讨厌他们俩。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>We had a new reading textbook, a thick one with a brown-and-orange cover, and during recess I hid in the bathroom and read ahead. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>除了新老师，我们还有了一本新的阅读课本，厚厚的，封面是褐色和橘色。每当兴趣小组时间到，我就藏在盥洗室里，自己看书。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>On my third day of hiding in the bathroom, the janitor caught me and told Miss Connolly, who gave me a lecture about good citizenship. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>在我藏在盥洗室的第三天，我被巡逻的老师抓到了，他把我交给了康诺丽小姐，结果，我被康诺丽小姐好好教育了一顿什么叫守纪律。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>She didn't look beautiful then. She looked like an angry horse, and that made me cry. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>这会儿她看起来一点都不漂亮了，真的活像一匹暴怒的马，吓得我哭了出来。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>She gave me a hug and told me that she understood but I couldn't skip recess anymore. I had to do what everybody else did. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>康诺丽小姐只好抱了抱我，安慰我说她能理解我讨厌兴趣小组，但是我真的不能再逃了，我得跟别人做一样的事。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>So I promised. But I still read ahead in the brown-and-orange book.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>我同意了，但我还是在读这本书。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>In third grade, we played dodgeball during recess. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>三年级的时候，我们的兴趣小组活动是打躲避球。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>I liked dodgeball, because I was good at it. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>我喜欢躲避球，因为我擅长这个。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>I was skinny and quick and I could see, ahead of time, where someone was going to throw the ball and I'd get out of the way, so the ball would hit someone else, someone who was fat or slow. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>我瘦小灵活，预见球的路线后能迅速地躲开它，然后这个球就会打在那些肥胖笨拙的人身上。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>My friend Billy Muir was fat and slow, but he was an exception. He managed to avoid getting hit most of the time. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>我的朋友比利·缪尔就是个笨拙的胖子，但他却意外的是个高手，他能躲过大部分球。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Billy Muir's father always wore a suit. He was successful in business, so he was transferred to the Chicago branch of his company, where he continued to be successful until his supervisors discovered that he was embezzling money and he hanged himself. With his belt. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>比利·缪尔的父亲经常穿着一身西装，他的业绩很优秀，所以被他的公司派往了芝加哥分部。在那儿，他也干的很好，但是当审计员发现他挪用公款后，他就用皮带上吊自杀了。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>That was later. In third grade, Billy Muir had no idea that his father would end up famous. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>这是后头的事儿了，三年级的时候，比利根本不会去想他父亲会死。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Billy was fat and slow but he could dodge the ball anyway, so that was something to think about. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>比利胖胖的，动作也很迟缓，但是无论如何，他总是能躲过那些球，这让我想不通。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>But the big thing to think about was the new girl. Her name was Beverly, just like the LaPlante girl who had disappeared the winter before, but this new Beverly was pretty and she laughed all the time.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>当然啦，最让我在意的还是新来的那个女孩，她的名字也是贝弗莉，跟在冬天离开的那个拉普朗特一样，但是这个“新贝弗莉”很漂亮，而且她总是笑眯眯的。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>I was the best in the class at dodgeball, but on the day the new girl arrived I was the first one out, which made me miserable. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>我是这个班里躲避球玩的最好的，但是这个新来的姑娘加入的时候，我是这局球里第一个被淘汰的，这让我很难过。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>It was fair, but it was wrong, because I wasn't paying attention and the ball hit me while I was thinking about the "Little Mermaid" story I was reading. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>游戏仍是公平的，但我输得莫名其妙，因为球扔过来的时候我心不在焉，当时我在想我读到的故事，汉斯·克里斯汀·安徒生写得那个《小美人鱼》。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>By Hans Christian Andersen, with an "e" instead of an "o." Now that I was out, I began to pay attention to the game. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>虽然我被淘汰了，我还在关注这局游戏。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Standing at the edge of the circle, I could get a good look at everybody, and that was when I recognized the new girl. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>站在游戏划定的范围外，我能很好地观察到每一个人，结果我突然意识到一件事！这个新来的姑娘就是贝弗莉！</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Her hair was short now and she was a different Beverly LaPlante, but she was Beverly LaPlante all the same. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>虽然她头发剪短了，看起来是个完全不一样的贝弗莉·拉普朗特，但她的的确确就是原来那个！</seg>

</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>How was this possible? </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>这怎么可能？</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>She was wearing a Girl Scout outfit with clumsy Girl Scout shoes. She was talking and laughing and making noise, and, when Billy Muir got hit and had to go outside the circle, she noticed the angry face he made and she said, "Jesus Christ! Your face would sour the milk!"</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>她穿着女童子军的外套和笨重的女童子军鞋，又笑又闹的，当比利·缪尔被她淘汰出圈的时候，她注意到了他愤怒的表情，大笑道：“耶稣基督啊！你的脸臭的都能让牛奶发酸了！”</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Nobody seemed to hear her, but I did and I looked at Miss Connolly, who made a horse face, which meant that she had heard her, too. But she didn't say anything. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>好像没人听见贝弗莉的话，但是我听见了，我看见康诺丽小姐拉长了一张马脸，这说明她也听见了，不过她什么都没说。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Taking the Lord's name in vain was wrong and therefore Miss Connolly was wrong to pretend she hadn't heard. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>妄称圣子之名犯了大错，所以康诺丽小姐假装什么也没听见也是错的。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>But then Joycie Adams got hit by the ball and just stood there like a dummy until everyone yelled at her that she had to leave the circle. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>就在这时，洁茜·亚当斯也被砸中了，但她还固执地站在那儿，直到大伙儿喊她出去。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>She said that it wasn't fair, because the ball had barely hit her, and Beverly said, "What the hell! Don't be such a damn crybaby." </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>她大叫着这不公平，因为球只是擦着她过去了。贝弗莉大声嘲讽道：“那又怎么样！蠢兮兮的爱哭鬼！”</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Everybody heard her this time and turned toward Miss Connolly, who finally said, "Now, now! Language, please!" </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>这回，所有人都听见了，大家齐刷刷地看向了康诺丽小姐，她厉声道：“注意你的言辞，贝弗莉！”</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>The kids all went quiet, waiting to see what would happen, but Beverly laughed into the silence and said, "Shit, piss, fuck!"</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>所有人都噤声了，一片沉默。然而贝弗莉不依不饶，她挑衅的讥笑在所有人耳边回荡：“呸！去死吧！狗日的！”</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Miss Connolly said very loudly, "Time for class, people! Everybody to the stairs now. Now! Not tomorrow!" </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>康诺丽小姐气得大声咆哮起来：“你们！都给我回去上课！所有人都给我站到台阶上去！立刻！马上！”</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>She said "people" in that special voice, so we all ran to the front stairs and waited. </seg>

<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>她喊“你们”的时候声音都变了，我们赶紧跑到了第一层台阶上站好。</seg>

<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Miss Connolly took Beverly aside and we couldn't hear what she said, but Beverly just laughed again and said something back. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>康诺丽小姐把贝弗莉单独拎出来带到了一边，我们听不见她在说什么，不过我看见贝弗莉一直在冷笑，回敬了好几句。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Miss Connolly took Beverly's arm and shook it hard, but Beverly pulled away and ran to the center of the dodgeball circle, where she did a little dance in her Girl Scout shoes, shouting over and over, "Jesus Christ and shit, piss, fuck! Jesus Christ and shit, piss, fuck!" </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>康诺丽小姐狠命摇晃着贝弗莉的胳膊，但她使劲甩开了老师的手，跑到躲避球划定的圈里跳起了乱七八糟的舞，边跳边嚷嚷：“耶稣基督是个傻逼！耶稣基督算个屁！”</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>She shouted as if she had finally discovered the truth and couldn't wait to tell the world. </seg>

<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>The bad words were wrong, of course, and taking the Lord's name in vain was wrong, but it was more complicated than that. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>说脏话当然是错的，妄称圣子之名也是错的，而且这个错误远比前面那个大。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>It was something about Beverly herself. I wondered what had happened to her that made her happy now, but with dirty words, when a year ago she had just cried all the time. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>贝弗莉身上一定发生了什么，她身上发生的事情让她变得开朗起来，不像一年前那样总是哭哭啼啼的，但是同时也让她变得爱说脏话。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>She wasn't like any of us. She didn't belong. She didn't fit in. </seg>

<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>这样的贝弗莉和我们中的任何一个人都不像，她和我们格格不入，无法相处。</seg>
</tuv>

<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>我也不行，不过我总是在试图让自己看起来和大家都一样，并且也没人发现我其实是不同的，现在，我偷偷地想，我是不是和贝弗莉·拉普朗特是同类人？</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>I began to think of her when I was supposed to be doing arithmetic and geography, which were no fun anyway. I began to think of her on the walk to school each day and again on the walk home. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>我总是想起贝弗莉，无论是当我做无趣的算术题和地理题的时候，还是在我上学和我回家的路上，我都会想起她。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Then, one night, when I said my prayers before bed, I finished up with the sign of the cross and, trying not to say it, I said, "Please, God, let Beverly LaPlante die." </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>有一天晚上，当我做睡前祷告的时候，我画完十字，说出了我一直不敢开口的话：“求求您，上帝，求您杀了贝弗莉·拉普朗特......</seg>

<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>It was a real prayer and I knew it was wrong and I would go to Hell. </seg>

<seg>我赶紧说：“不，我收回这句话。”然而你知道，祷告是无法收回的。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>I said a lot of Our Fathers and after a while I felt that maybe I wouldn't go to Hell and I should stop thinking about Beverly. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>我数次持诵主之名，过了一会儿，我觉得我应该不用下地狱了，我还觉得我不能继续想贝弗莉的事情了。</seg>

<seg>I began to understand that people disappeared and changed and sometimes they hanged themselves or came back different and still didn't fit in. People were a mystery, I decided, like the Resurrection at Sunday school. Jesus died and was buried and then he rose from the dead. He said hello to Mary Magdalene- she was the first to see him, because she had washed his feet and dried them with her hair- and later he made breakfast for his disciples to prove that he had died and then come back real. </seg>

<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>我开始意识到一件事，那就是人们离开之后，会换一个身份回来，他们有的让自己变得合群了，有的即使换了个样子还是不合群。人类是种谜一样的生物，我想，就像主日学校里教的复活节的故事，耶稣在坟墓里死而复生，第一个有幸见到他的人是玛丽·玛格达莱妮，因为她曾为耶稣洗脚，并用自己的长发擦干了它们。耶稣向她打了个招呼。之后，他又为自己的门徒做了一顿早餐，证明他真的死而复生了。</seg>
