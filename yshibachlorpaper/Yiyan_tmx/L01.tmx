<seg>This happened here in our town. </seg>

<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>这件事发生在我们的镇上。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>A friend of mine- we were on the cheerleading team together- married a local farmer, and right away they wanted to have a baby, though the doctor said she shouldn't. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>我的一位朋友——曾经的啦啦队队友——嫁给了当地的一位农民。他们才结婚就想要孩子，可是医生说不行。</seg>

<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>She was a bleeder, he said, and if she started he might not be able to stop it. But she didn't listen. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>医生说，她容易出血，而且出血的话恐怕会止不住，可是她不听劝。</seg>

<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>She went ahead and got pregnant, then bled to death during childbirth and was buried out by the farmhouse, under a crabapple tree. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>她怀上了孩子，在分娩的时候出血死亡，被葬在农舍边上的花红树下。</seg>

<seg>It was very sad. I cried for a week. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>这让人很难过，我哭了一个星期。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>But the baby survived, a pretty little boy; his dad called him Dickie- boy, but I don't know if that was his real name.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>不过，她的孩子活了下来。他是个漂亮的小男生，父亲叫他驴蛋，不过我不知道那是不是他的真名。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>His dad was a hard worker and a nice guy- I went on a movie date with him once when we were young- but he sometimes drank too much and he was hopeless at ordinary household chores and raising babies. So pretty soon he found another wife, either through a dating service or else he picked her up in one of his bars somewhere, because none of us girls knew her. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>他的父亲很勤劳，人也还不错——年轻的时候我和他约会看过电影——只是他有些时候会酗酒，而且对家务事和养孩子一窍不通，所以他很快就又找了个妻子。这个妻子要么是他通过婚介服务找来的，要么是他在某家酒吧带回来的，因为我们这些姑娘都不认识她。</seg>

<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>She was a tough, sexy lady, a hooker, maybe. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>她是个蛮横、性感的女人，或许还是个妓女。</seg>

<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>她没有试着融入我们，也没有试着让我们喜欢她。</seg>

<seg>I guess she considered us beneath her. </seg>

<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>我猜她是觉得我们都不如她。</seg>

</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>We called her the Vamp. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>我们叫他妖妇。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>She got around, and it was said that she'd taken half the men in town to bed, my own ex included. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>她到处闲逛，据说镇上半数的男人都被她勾引上过床，其中还有我的前任。</seg>

</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>They all denied it, like cheating husbands do, but, when the subject came up, little shit-eating grins would appear on their faces and their eyes would glaze over as if they were remembering the wild time they'd had.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>他们都不承认，出轨的丈夫都会这样，但只要谈到这个话题，他们的脸上就会挂起尴尬的嬉笑，目光就会变得呆滞，似乎是在回忆曾经的巫山云雨。</seg>

<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Maybe Dickie-boy's dad knew about all that, and maybe he didn't. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>驴蛋的父亲或许知道这些事情，或许也并不知道。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>He was mostly either drunk or out in the fields, and he left the raising of the kid to his new wife. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>大多数情况下，他要么是酩酊大醉，要么是在地里，把养孩子的事情交给新任妻子。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>He loved Dickie-boy to the extent that the child reminded him of his dead wife, but resented him for the same reason, just as he resented the boy's mother for selfishly dying on him. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>他很爱驴蛋，以至于驴蛋会让他想起亡妻。出于同样的原因，他也憎恨驴蛋，就如同怨恨孩子的母亲自私地抛下他死去。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>He had hoped for a sturdy fellow to help around the farm, but Dickie-boy was a sickly, fine-boned child who had trouble lifting a finger to pick his nose, forget pitchforks and shovels. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>他本来希望农场里能有个强健的家伙帮忙，可是驴蛋体弱多病、骨瘦如柴，连动手抠鼻子都困难，更不用说使干草叉和铲子了。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Certainly he didn't get on with the Vamp, who had a mean temper and slapped him around, with or without an excuse.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>驴蛋和妖妇的关系自然不好，妖妇脾气暴躁，常常不分青红皂白地扇他耳光。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>The Vamp had a daughter from a previous relationship, a cute kid with big dreamy eyes, called Marleen. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>妖妇有个女儿，是从之前的感情里带来的。她叫玛莲，长着一双漂亮的大眼睛。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>I never knew what to make of her. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>我根本搞不懂她。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Marleen seemed to live in a storybook land of her own. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>她似乎是生活在自己的童话王国里。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>When she spoke, she spoke to the world, the way singers do, and what she said seldom made any sense. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>在她说话的时候，她就像歌手那样，对着世界说话，而且她的话基本上没有意义。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>You probably had to be a kid to understand her at all. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>想要理解她，你或许得是个孩子。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>My little girl- she's a young woman now and has her own little girl- was the same age as Marleen, and sometimes the two of them played together, my daughter pedalling her bike out to the farm and back, or sometimes I took her and picked her up. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>我的女儿——现在是个年轻女性，也有了自己的女儿——和玛莲同岁。她俩有时会在一起玩耍——我女儿骑着单车往返她家农场，或者有时由我负责接送。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>My daughter had a lot of stories about Marleen, but I didn't always understand those, either.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>我女儿讲过许多关于玛莲的故事，可是我无法全都理解。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Marleen settled right in with her new little stepbrother. They were as tight as crib siblings and had a way of talking to each other that didn't use words. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>玛莲和她的继弟合得来，他们像亲兄妹那样亲密，有着一种不用言语也能相互交流的方法。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>My daughter said it might be bird talk, which Marleen had offered to teach her. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>我女儿说那可能是鸟语，而且玛莲说过要教她。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Some people said that Dickie-boy wasn't all there, others that he had something almost magical about him. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>有人说驴蛋神志不正常，也有人说他拥有近乎魔法的东西。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Once, for example, he somehow crawled up onto the barn roof, and they had to call the Fire Department to get him down. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>比如说，他有次不知怎的爬到了谷仓顶上，人们叫来消防队才把他救下来。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>The fire marshal said he had no idea how the boy could have got up there, unless he flew. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>消防队长说，除非驴蛋能飞，不然他还真不知道他是怎么上去的。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Marleen said he did it because the birds wanted him to. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>玛莲说，驴蛋爬到房顶去，是因为鸟儿让他那样做。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>She told my daughter that the crabapple tree had helped him, though it was over near the house, not the barn. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>她告诉我女儿，那棵花红树帮了驴蛋，尽管它是在住房而非谷仓边上。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>I had no idea what she meant. My daughter didn't know, either, and Marleen never announced it in her peculiar way of speaking.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>我不知道她的意思是什么，我女儿也不知道，而且玛莲从来没有用她那奇特的说话方式说过。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>My daughter and Marleen played dolls and house and nursie, just like all little girls do, and sometimes they used Dickie-boy in their games. In nice ways and maybe not-so-nice ways. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>和其他小女生一样，我女儿和玛莲会玩过家家，有些时候她们会在游戏里利用驴蛋，方式有时友好，有时或许并不那么友好。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Strange Marleen might get up to anything, and my own daughter had a mischievous and curious streak, so things probably happened. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>奇怪的玛莲可能会做出任何事，而我的女儿也有着顽皮和好奇的性格，所以或许确实发生过一些事情。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Kids are kids, after all. I figured it was best to mostly look the other way. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>孩子毕竟是孩子，我觉得多数情况下最好是换个角度看事情。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>

<seg>Children have to be allowed to grow up on their own- I've always believed that.</seg>

<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>我始终相信，孩子应该能够自由地成长。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Marleen wanted a doggy, for example, so she put a collar and a leash on Dickie-boy and walked him around on his hands and knees with his clothes off and did circus tricks with him. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>例如，玛莲想要小狗，所以就给驴蛋套上项圈，拴上绳子，让他脱掉衣服，爬在地上四处遛他，而且还用他玩些马戏一样的把戏。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>She even taught him to wee with his leg in the air. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>她甚至教他在尿尿时抬起一只脚。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>He never complained. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>他从未抱怨过。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>When he did bad things, like biting the mailman or pooping on his stepmother's bed, Marleen swatted his behind with a rolled-up newspaper just as you would a puppy. Then he'd whimper until she scratched between his ears and gave him a cookie. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>如果他做了坏事，比如说咬了邮递员，或者在继母床上大便，玛莲就会像你打小狗那样，卷起报纸拍打他的屁股，而他会则会抽泣，直到玛莲挠挠他的后脑勺，给他一块饼干。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>My daughter said that Dickie-boy seemed to do bad things on purpose so as to get swatted. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>我女儿说，驴蛋好像是为了被打，才故意做坏事的。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>I suppose he was just looking for attention, given the kind of parents he had. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>我想，鉴于他拥有那样的父母，他那样做只是为得到关注。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>His dad was never around, and the Vamp hated him, so all he had was Marleen and her games.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>他父亲从不在身边，而且妖妇很讨厌他，所以他所拥有的只有玛莲和她的游戏。</seg>

</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Dickie-boy wasn't very healthy, but whenever he got sick Marleen made him well again. </seg>

<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>驴蛋不是很健康，但只要他生病，玛莲都会让他康复。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>It was a gift she had. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>这是她的天赋。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>It sometimes worked on others, too. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>有些时候，这种天赋甚至在别人身上也有用。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>One time, my daughter had a bad case of tonsillitis, and I thought her tonsils would have to come out, but Marleen somehow brought her fever down and she hasn't had tonsillitis since. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>有一次，我女儿患了严重的扁桃体炎，我以为她得去把扁桃体切除，可玛莲不知怎的给她降了烧，而她再也没有患过扁桃体炎了。</seg>

</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Marleen couldn't do anything for my ingrown toenail and canker sores, though.</seg>

<seg>不过，对于我脚趾甲长到肉里和我的口腔溃疡，玛莲却无能为力。</seg>

<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Dickie-boy had gifts, too, and one of them was finding lost things. </seg>

<seg>驴蛋也有许多天赋，其中之一便是寻找失物。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Once, I lost an earring, and my daughter brought Marleen and Dickie-boy over to the house to find it. </seg>

<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>有一次，我掉了一只耳环，我的女儿把玛莲和驴蛋带到家里面来找。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>He got down on all fours with his face near the floor, and Marleen showed him the matching earring and made a chirping noise that probably meant "Fetch!," because that's exactly what he did. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>驴蛋趴在地上，脸贴近地板。玛莲给他看了另外一只耳环，然后发出唧唧的声音，意思或许是“去找回来！”，因为他确实去把那只耳环找了回来。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>It had fallen into one of my old sneakers in the closet. </seg>

<seg>他还找回来一把我都不知道已经丢失了的指甲刷。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Hide-and-seek wasn't any fun at all, my daughter said, because Dickie-boy always went straight to where they were. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>躲猫猫没有意思，我女儿说，因为驴蛋总是能直接找到她们的藏身处。</seg>

</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Same with blindman's bluff- it was as if he could see right through the blindfold. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>蒙眼捉迷藏也一样——他似乎能看穿蒙眼的布条。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>And ghost-in-the-graveyard, if you played it at night, could be downright scary, because he could give you the feeling that he was there and not there at the same time.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>在晚上玩“鬼来了”[1]的游戏特别恐怖，因为他会让你觉得他在那里，同时也会让你觉得他没在那里。</seg>

<seg>Marleen often played with Dickie-boy the way you'd play with a rag doll, tossing him floppily about, dangling him by an arm or leg, he looking glassy- eyed and like he'd lost his bones. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>玛莲经常像玩布娃娃那样玩驴蛋，轻轻地摇晃他，拉着手或脚把他提起来，而驴蛋则会目光呆滞的看着，而且像是没有了骨头一样。</seg>

<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>玛莲告诉她，她母亲讨厌驴蛋，把驴蛋的头割了下来，然后又用胶水粘了回去，而且没有告诉她，所以在她们玩耍的时候驴蛋的头才会掉下来，这应该怪她母亲。</seg>

<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>But the police chief, who went to investigate the death, told me that, after talking with the boy's folks, he was convinced it was just a tragic household accident that the little girl was inventing wild stories about.</seg>
