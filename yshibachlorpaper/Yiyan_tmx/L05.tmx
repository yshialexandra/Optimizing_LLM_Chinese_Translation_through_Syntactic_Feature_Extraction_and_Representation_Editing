<seg>Soon he came to a parting of the ways; leading from the highway was a road less travelled, having the appearance, indeed, of having been long abandoned, because, he thought, it led to something evil; yet he turned into it without hesitation, impelled by some imperious necessity.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>不久，他来到一个岔路口，连着公路的那条路人影全无，看起来废弃已久的样子；其中的原因，他也想到了——也许这条路通向某个邪恶的地方。不过，他还是毫不犹豫地走了上去，似乎有一种无法抗拒的力量在驱使着他。</seg>

</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">

<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>So frightful was the situation- the mysterious light burned with so silent and awful a menace; the noxious plants, the trees that by common consent are invested with a melancholy or baleful character, so openly in his sight conspired against his peace; from overhead and all about came so audible and startling whispers and the sighs of creatures so obviously not of earth- that he could endure it no longer, and with a great effort to break some malign spell that bound his faculties to silence and inaction, he shouted with the full strength of his lungs! </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>那场景实在令人毛骨悚然：死一般的沉寂，神秘慑人的幽光，散发毒气的植物，阴险邪恶的树木，每样东西似乎都在他眼皮底下串通起来，让他不得安宁。头上、天空中，身体的四周，隐隐传来可怕的耳语声和叹息声；声音清晰可辨。很明显，发出这种声音的生物，不可能来自人间。他再也无法忍受下去，于是他使出浑身力气，试图挣脱那个缚住他的声音和手脚的邪恶咒语。他扯开了嗓子，大喊一声！</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">

<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>He had hardly touched the paper with the point of his twig when a low, wild peal of laughter broke out at a measureless distance away, and growing ever louder, seemed approaching ever nearer; a soulless, heartless, and unjoyous laugh, like that of the loon, solitary by the lakeside at midnight; a laugh which culminated in an unearthly shout close at hand, then died away by slow gradations, as if the accursed being that uttered it had withdrawn over the verge of the world whence it had come. </seg>

<seg>老弗雷泽从政（看起来南方的有钱人似乎都在干这一行）；他们的国家（也许应该说，他们所属地或州政府）迫切需要父亲这样的人付出大量的时间和心力，因此，耳中充斥上司吼叫的父亲，不得不对家庭装聋作哑，拿不出一点儿时间照顾的家人，包括他自己。</seg>

<seg>Among those of his relations who professed the modern faith of heredity it was well understood that in him the character of the late Myron Bayne, a maternal great-grandfather, had revisited the glimpses of the moon- by which orb Bayne had in his lifetime been sufficiently affected to be a poet of no small Colonial distinction. </seg>

<seg>If not specially observed, it was observable that while a Frayser who was not the proud possessor of a sumptuous copy of the ancestral 'poetical works' (printed at the family expense, and long ago withdrawn from an inhospitable market) was a rare Frayser indeed, there was an illogical indisposition to honour the great deceased in the person of his spiritual successor. Halpin was pretty generally deprecated as an intellectual black sheep who was likely at any moment to disgrace the flock by bleating in metre. </seg>

<seg>另外，你还不难发现，弗雷泽家人手一本精装《先祖诗集摘抄》（该诗集由家庭自费印刷，因销量不大早已停售）并引以为荣，否则根本算不上弗雷泽家的一员。可有一点不太合乎情理：大家对祖上敬爱有加，却对其精神传人普遍不太感冒；究其原因，也许赫尔平不分场合吟诗作赋酸腐气，经常搞得大家在众人面前下不来台，所以他成了家族的害群之马、众矢之的。</seg>
