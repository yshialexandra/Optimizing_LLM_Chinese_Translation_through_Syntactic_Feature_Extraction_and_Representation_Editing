<seg>我高兴地看到下面大街上空，北极星闪耀着。万一要紧急撤离会是个帮助。胡思乱想点儿既刺激又危险的事儿，是打发北达科他冬天的一个办法。</seg>

<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>When I looked out to the northeast, I saw a big red glow. </seg>

<seg>After that we just kept quiet while we pulled on wool socks and our heavy outer garments. We waddled to the car looking like those moon walkers. </seg>

<seg>It hadn't snowed since the big blizzard, so the road beds were clear, but there were six-foot walls of snow pushed out onto the shoulders by the snow plows. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>暴风雪之后没再下雪，路面很干净。扫雪车扫出的雪堆在路肩上，成了两堵墙，有六英尺高。</seg>

</tu>
<tu>

<seg>"At least their driveway is plowed out today," I said as we passed their mail box sticking up out of the snow bank. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>“不过，他们家的车道今天倒是请扫雪机扫了。”</seg>
</tuv>

<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>By now the fire engine was coming up the driveway, but I was aiming to find the other twin.</seg>

<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Most of the fire was in the back, and the front of the house was standing there looking normal. </seg>

<seg>乡村的人没有走前门的。我费力跨过雪墙来到门前，用尽最后一丝力气才把门打开。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>I should have known better than to do that, because when the door opened up it let in a cross draft of air that set off a ball of fire inside that house, roaring like a tornado moving across the prairie. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>门一开我就后悔了。穿堂风刮进来，屋里炸起一个火球，轰隆隆像龙卷风刮过草原。</seg>

<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>One of those twins was sitting naked except for a pair of work boots, tied up hands and feet to a chair. </seg>
