<seg>看到慈悲能沉浸得这么投入、这么持久——居然还是在第一天就看到，这让他甚至感到些许嫉妒，不过过了一阵子，他将这种妒忌视作自私和伤人的想法，视作恶业、恶念而清除掉。</seg>

<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>He led her to the entrance of the yurt and pointed to the place where he'd been sitting in the poor stippled shade of a palo verde tree and then used the distance between his forefinger and thumb to give her an idea of the creature and its relative size, jerking that space back and forth vigorously to replicate its movements and finally flinging his hand out to demonstrate the path it had taken. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>他带着慈悲来到蒙古包的门口，指着他一直坐着的那块地方，假紫荆树零星斑驳的树荫下，并用食指和拇指的间距比划着，让慈悲对假紫荆树及其相对的大小有个概念，同时使劲地来回伸缩间距，并反复这样运动，最后甩开手，展现出运动的路径。</seg>

<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Three syllables, he indicated digitally, making his face go fierce for the representation of dragon- he breathed fire, or tried to- and then softening it for the notion of fly, and he'd been helped here by the appearance, against the front window, of an actual fly, a fat bluebottle that had no doubt sprung from the desiccating carcass of some fallen toad or lizard. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>三个音节，他用数字表示，面部的表情强烈表现着龙的模样——吸火喷火，或想要吸火喷火的样子——然后松弛下来，表现飞的意思，他靠着前窗，做出一只青蝇的样子，真的就是从哪个干瘪的癞蛤蟆或蜥蜴躯壳里飞出来的，他这样做助了自己一臂之力。</seg>
</tuv>

<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>She'd blinked rapidly. She'd smiled. </seg>

<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">

<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>在他看来，尽管慈悲极其费心地关注着他脸上的极乐表情，却一点也没有领悟到他尽力传达的内容。</seg>

<seg>But now she was bending to the oven, where the flattened balls of dough were taking on the appearance of bread, her meditation skirt hitched up in back so that he was able to admire the shape of her ankles, a shape as miraculous as that of the dragonfly- or no, a thousand times more so. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>不过现在慈悲正俯身看着烤炉，里面一团团的面团正呈现出面包的形状，慈悲的静修裙子后面提了起来，他能欣赏到慈悲的脚踝形状，就同蜻蜓的形状一样神奇——或许还不止，还要神奇一千倍。</seg>
