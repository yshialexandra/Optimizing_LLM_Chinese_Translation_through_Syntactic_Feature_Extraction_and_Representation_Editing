<seg>A month from now, rather than telling Henry and Ted about England, Zichen knew she would be relating tales of her parents' trip to Thailand: the crowded marketplace after nightfall, the cabaret show that they disliked but felt obliged to enjoy because it was said to be the highlight of their tour, the hotel bed that was too hard, or perhaps too soft. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>自晨知道，一个月之后，她不会给亨利和泰德讲英格兰，而是会把父母在泰国的旅程说给他们听：日落后熙攘的集市；作为旅行重头戏的歌舞表演——他们不喜欢，但不去看的话又感觉未免可惜；旅店的床太硬，或者说成太软也行。</seg>

<seg>There were other moments, also imagined, though these she would keep to herself: her father's insistence on splitting a dish in a restaurant because he was unwilling to pay for two, her mother eying a grain of rice on her father's sleeve without pointing it out. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>她还想象了别的情景，不过她不会把这些讲给别人听：在某个餐馆，她父亲坚持要分吃一份饭菜，因为他不愿付双份的钱；她母亲瞟着他父亲衣袖上的一粒米饭，却又不指出来。</seg>

</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>When the expression was explained to her, she thought of the way her grandmother used to clip her hair shorter than a boy's, in summer or winter, but this would not make a good office tale.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>听到解释后，她想起小时候，无论寒暑，外婆总是把她的头发剪得比男孩子的还短，但这个可算不上什么好故事，不适合拿出来在办公室讲。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Zichen had grown up in her grandmother's hair salon- a small shack really, at the entrance of an apartment complex, with a wooden plank propped up by two stacks of bricks that served as a bench for the waiting customers, a folding chair in front of a mirror that hung from a low beam, and a makeshift washstand, next to which a kettle of water was kept warm on a coal stove. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>自晨是在她外婆的发廊里长大的——说是发廊，实际上就是架在居民楼门口的一座小棚子，两摞砖上架条木板就算是长凳，供等着理发的顾客坐，一张折叠椅，椅子前面是一面挂在矮梁上的镜子，镜子旁边是一架凑合能用的脸盆架，架子边上是一个小煤炉，炉上架着壶水，水总是热的。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>On the curtain that separated the salon from the bed shared by Zichen and her grandmother, there were prints of bunnies, white on a green-and-yellow background. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>自晨和她外婆共用的床铺在后面，用一道帘子和发廊分开，帘子黄绿相间，上面印着白色的小兔子。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>There was no window in the shack, and a fluorescent light was turned on the moment her grandmother opened up the shop and continued buzzing until the end of the day, giving everything a perpetual bluish-white hue.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>棚子没有窗户，从外婆开门营业，直到一天忙完，都开着一盏日光灯，嗡嗡作响，给一切镀上一层泛青的白色。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>That her grandmother could have had an easier life in her old age was made clear to Zichen from her first years: Zichen's two uncles- her mother's elder brothers- would have dutifully taken in their mother, and between the two families they would have seen to it that she had a decent retirement. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>从孩提起，自晨就清楚，外婆本可以过一个轻松的晚年：自晨的两个舅舅——她母亲的两个哥哥——本会将外婆接去尽孝，他们两家本会确保外婆在退休之后能过得体体面面的。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>But how could you burden your own sons with a child like that? her grandmother used to ask her customers, as though the time Zichen had spent in the shop learning to sit up and then to walk, and later to assist her grandmother, handing her warm towels or cleaning the ashtrays- two blue-and-white china bowls placed at either end of the bench, the rims chipped, filled with smoldering cigarette ends and streaks of ash- had never softened the shock of the child's existence. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>但你怎么能领着这样一个小孩，去给自己的儿子增添负担呢？她外婆常常这么问来理发的人，好似自晨在这家店里所呆的这些日子，从刚会坐起身子，到蹒跚学步，到后来给外婆打下手，给她递热毛巾，清洗烟灰缸——就是放在长凳两头的两个蓝白瓷碗，碗口坑坑缺缺，满是将熄未熄的烟头和一道道的烟灰——从没能缓解她的存在所带来的冲击。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>It would have been a different story had she been an orphan, her grandmother would say; it would have been sensible for any uncle to take in an orphan, a statement her audience readily agreed with. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>如果她是个孤儿的话，情况就不一样了，她外婆会接着说，哪个舅舅会那么狠心不接受一个孤儿呢？这一说法，听众都欣然赞同。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Indeed, a woman who had run away with a man against her family's wish, who had given birth to a baby out of wedlock, and had then been abandoned by the man- that mother would have done her baby more of a favor had she died during childbirth.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>确实，一个女人，不顾家人的反对，与一个男人私奔，没结婚就生下个孩子，接着又被那个男人抛弃——这位母亲还不如难产而死，这样对小孩更好。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>It hadn't taken long for Zichen to piece together her own story from the parts alluded to by her grandmother and uncles and customers and neighbors: that her grandmother had agreed to raise her on the condition that her mother sever all connections with the family; that a couple had once come to the shop to look her over, but then decided not to adopt her; that she owed her life not only to her grandmother, who had to toil at an age when other women could rest, but also to the patrons of the shop, who remained loyal to her grandmother because of the responsibility they felt toward her.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>凭着从外婆、舅舅、顾客和邻居那里听来的只言片语，自晨很早就拼凑出自己的身世：她的外婆答应抚养她，条件是母亲和整个家庭断绝关系；曾有一对夫妇来到店里看过，但后来还是没有收养她；她能活到现在，不仅仅受恩于外婆——她一把年纪了，本来该去享清福的，却还在辛劳，还要感谢来店里理发的人——他们是外婆的忠实顾客，因为他们觉得对她负有一份责任。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Sitting on a bamboo stool in a corner and listening to her own luck, both good and bad, discussed, Zichen would clandestinely move her feet and make piles of hair according to a system known only to her. </seg>

<seg>坐在角落里的竹凳上，听着人们讨论她的命运，好的坏的，自晨会悄悄地拿脚拨弄地上的头发，按照只有她自个儿知道的方式，把它们拨成一堆一堆的。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Inevitably the game would be interrupted by the strokes of her grandmother's broom, but even that did not disturb Zichen, as the disassembling of the small hills of hair could also be part of her scheme. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>外婆总是会给她一笤帚，打断这个小小的游戏，但这也扫不了自晨的兴，因为把堆成小山一样的头发拨散开来，也是游戏的一部分。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Quit grinning like an idiot, her grandmother would sometimes tell Zichen, turning from her clipping, and Zichen would straighten her face, but when her grandmother turned back to her customer she smiled again at the back of a man's half-shaved head, or at the shoelaces of someone waiting on the bench. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>别龇牙咧嘴地像个傻瓜，外婆有时会停下手里的剪子，回过头来冲自晨说。自晨会收起笑容，不过等到外婆转向顾客，她又会朝着那剪了一半的后脑勺，或是朝着某个等在长凳上的人的鞋带，露出微笑。</seg>
</tuv>
