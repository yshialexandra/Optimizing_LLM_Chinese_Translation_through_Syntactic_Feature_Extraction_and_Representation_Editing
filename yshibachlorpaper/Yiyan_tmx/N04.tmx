<seg>What will you do with your life if you don't catch up with your schoolwork? her grandmother's customers ceaselessly asked her; not knowing the answer, she would smile as though she did not understand the question, and it was her smile more than her grades that had marked her as beyond teachable.</seg>

<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">

<seg>But an ex-husband was easy to be done with and never mentioned again, while a pair of parents, even if they lived on another continent, needed careful maintenance: an annual trip; phone calls that brought news from China; presents to take home- Wisconsin ginseng for her father, anti-aging cream for her mother.</seg>

<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">

<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Together they, rather than an early widowhood, were blamed for her grandmother's harsh life; together they had been the old woman's disappointments, a daughter who had brought humiliation to the family, a granddaughter who had rashly married a man she had met twice and had then been unable to stay married for longer than three years.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>人们指责说，外婆辛劳一生不是因为早寡，而是因为她们母女俩；她俩成了这位老太太的心头之痛，女儿给整个家带来耻辱，外孙女草草嫁给一个仅仅见面两次的男人，而且不到三年就离了婚。</seg>

<seg>泰德，在头几周，喜欢找到自晨给她讲些恶心吓人的故事；他最得意的那个，讲的是有一次他和亨利给一位神经病学家自制了一架给大鼠用的断头台。</seg>

</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>她也不怕更大一些的哺乳动物：那些在笼子里吵吵嚷嚷的猴子，当她去给它们喂食或是冲澡的时候，冲着她直做鬼脸；还有那些可怜兮兮从不叫唤的狗。</seg>

</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
