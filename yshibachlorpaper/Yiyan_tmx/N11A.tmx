<seg>They were supposed to be clearing the drive of rabbit droppings with spoons and plastic bags, for money, but they were all four hunkered in a semicircle under the pine trees, where they had set out tea things for their dolls, a pinecone on each tiny plate, a rabbit dropping in each tiny cup. </seg>

<seg>Jane scooped low to the ground under an awkward shot, getting it up with too much force just as the sleek black of the car eased into the edge of her vision; the ball on its elastic must have seemed smashed deliberately and vindictively against the car's side window (which luckily was not open). </seg>

<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>为了击打一个位置刁钻的球简把身子弯得很低，她用了很大的力气把球铲了起来，这时黑亮的汽车正好进入她视线的边缘。被弹性绳子牵着的橡皮球看起来好像是有意并且猛力地朝着汽车侧面的车窗打去，还好车窗是关着的。</seg>
