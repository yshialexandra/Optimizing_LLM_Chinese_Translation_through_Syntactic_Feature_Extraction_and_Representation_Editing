<seg>Mr. Allsop noticed them, because he knew most of the cars that visited the road, and he didn't recognize or much like the look of this one: an expensive dark-green sporty two-seater convertible, with one long-haired youth in a sloppy vest lolling in each seat, and one- smoking something that might have been more sinister than a cigarette- squeezed into the little luggage space behind, craning forward, as he was bound to, between his friends. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>艾尔索普先生留意到他们，因为他认识大部分开到这条路上来的车辆。也许是因为他感觉这辆车陌生，或者因为他喜欢这辆车的款式：这是一辆价格昂贵的深绿色双座运动型敞篷车，有两名身穿宽松背心的长发青年懒洋洋地分坐在前排两个座椅上，另外一名挤在后排行李厢里的青年正抽着可能比香烟更有害的东西，他伸长头颈把头伸到前排的两个朋友中间。</seg>

<seg>有些平常隐藏起来的东西现在暴露无遗了：她脸上透出一种红褐色的光采，她的雀斑多得惊人像是动物的伪装色，嘴唇和眼睑上面都是。</seg>

<seg>Daniel, the driver, Jane saw at once, was the best-looking of the three; in fact, he was crushingly beautiful- his features smudged and vivid at once, as if sketched in black ink- and her heart fastened on him. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">

<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>"Not in the back," she said, quite clear about it. Already, she didn't care for Nigel.</seg>

<seg>But she was disoriented: as they drove along, Paddy had pulled the elastic bands off her two bunches so that her hair blew crazily into all their faces. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>车开着的时候，帕迪把她头发上的两个橡皮圈扯了下来，于是她的头发披撒开来盖到了脸上。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Whipping across her vision, the strands of it were like a hallucination, distracting her from her larger bewilderment at half sitting on Paddy's knee, feeling Daniel ease his arm around her once, on a straight stretch when he wasn't changing gears. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>发丝在她眼前舞动拍打造成了一种幻觉，分散了她的注意力，她本该更加警觉，因为她正半坐在帕迪的膝盖上，并且丹尼尔伸开手臂揽在她腰上，当时车正走在一条直道上，丹尼尔无须换挡。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
