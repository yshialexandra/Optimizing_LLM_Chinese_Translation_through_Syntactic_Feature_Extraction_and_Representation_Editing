<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>第三个愿望</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Once there was a man who was driving in his car at dusk on a spring evening through part of the forestofSavernake. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>从前有个人在一个春天的傍晚开着车穿行于萨弗纳克森林。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>His name was Mr. Peters. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>他名叫皮特斯先生。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>The primroses were just beginning but the trees were still bare, and it was cold; the birds had stopped singing an hour ago.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>报春花刚刚开始开放，但是树木还是光秃秃的，天气还很寒冷；鸟在一个小时前就停止了歌唱。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>As Mr. Peters entered a straight, empty stretch of road he seemed to hear a faint crying, and a struggling and thrashing, as if somebody was in trouble far away in the trees. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>皮特斯先生驶入一段笔直的、空荡荡的路上时，他仿佛听到一声微弱的叫喊和挣扎扑打声，好像是有人在远处的树林里遇到了麻烦。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>He left his car and climbed the mossy bank beside the road. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>他离开车，爬上路边长满青苔的河岸。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Beyond the bank was an open slope of beech trees leading down to thorn bushes through which he saw the gleam of water. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>在河岸的那一边是一片开阔的长着山毛榉树的斜坡，一直通到底下的荆棘丛，透过荆棘丛他看到水的微光。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>He stood a moment waiting to try and discover where the noise was coming from, and presently heard a rustling and some strange cries in a voice which was almost human--and yet there was something too hoarse about it at one time and too clear and sweet at another. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>他站了一会儿，试图寻找那声音是从哪里来的，不一会儿他听到了沙沙声和一些奇怪的叫声，那叫声几乎是人类的声音——不过这声音有时有点太沙哑，有时又太清亮甜美。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Mr. Peters ran down the hill and as he neared the bushes he saw something white among them which was trying to extricate itself; coming closer he found that it was a swan that had become entangled in the thorns growing on the bank of the canal.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>皮特斯先生跑下斜坡，他走近荆棘丛时看到里面有白色的东西正在试图从中解脱出来；走得更近些，他发现是一只天鹅缠在生长在运河岸边的荆棘中了。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>The bird struggled all the more frantically as he approached, looking at him with hate in its yellow eyes, and when he took hold of it to free it, hissed at him, pecked him, and thrashed dangerously with its wings which were powerful enough to break his arm. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>这只鸟在他走近时挣扎得更疯狂，它黄色的眼睛里带着憎恨看着他，当他抓住它把它解救出来时，它对他发出咝咝声，啄他，用它那有力到足以打折他的胳膊的翅膀很凶险地拍打。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Nevertheless he managed to release it from the thorns, and carrying it tightly with one arm, holding the snaky head well away with the other hand (for he did not wish his eyes pecked out), he took it to the verge of the canal and dropped it in.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>不过他最终将它从荆棘丛中解救了出来，一只胳膊紧紧地抱着它，另一手离开身体远远地握着它阴险的头（因为他不希望自己的眼睛被啄出来），他把它带到河边，放进河里。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>The swan instantly assumed great dignity and sailed out to the middle of the water, where it put itself to rights with much dabbling and preening, smoothing its feathers with little showers of drops. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>这只天鹅立刻表现出极为高贵的样子，它游到水中央，在那里洒水、用嘴整理打扮、喷上连串的水珠抚平羽毛，把自己收拾好。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Mr. Peters waited, to make sure that it was all right and had suffered no damage in its struggles. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>皮特斯先生等着，以确定它没事，在它挣扎过程中没有遭受损伤。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Presently the swan, when it was satisfied with its appearance, floated in to the bank once more, and in a moment, instead of the great white bird, there was a little man all in green with a golden crown and long beard, standing by the water. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>不一会儿，当那只天鹅对自己的外表满意了时，它又一次游到岸边，只一瞬间，一个身材矮小、全身着绿、头戴一顶金色王冠、长着长长胡须的男人替换了那只白色的大鸟站在水边。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>He had fierce glittering eyes and looked by no means friendly.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>他目露凶光，看上去一点儿都不友好。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>"Well, Sir," he said threateningly, "I see you are presumptuous enough to know some of the laws of magic. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>“噢，先生，”他凶狠狠地说，“我知道你自以为懂一些魔法规则。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>You think that because you have rescued--by pure good fortune--the King of theForestfrom a difficulty, you should have some fabulous reward."</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>你认为因为你营救——纯粹是由于好运气——森林之王脱离困境，你就应该得到一些神奇的奖赏。”</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>"I expect three wishes, no more and no less," answered Mr. Peters, looking at him steadily and with composure.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>“我希望得到三个愿望，不多也不少，”皮特斯先生沉着坚定地看着他回答道。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>"Three wishes, he wants, the clever man! </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>“三个愿望，他想要，聪明人！</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Well, I have yet to hear of the human being who made any good use of his three wishes--they mostly end up worse off than they started. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>好吧，我还从未听说有人好好利用了他的三个愿望——他们的结果大都比开始时更糟。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Take your three wishes then--" he flung three dead leaves in the air "--don't blame me if you spend the last wish in undoing the work of the other two."</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>那就拿走你的三个愿望吧——”他向空中抛了三片枯叶“——要是你用最后一个愿望来取消另两个的后果，可别怪我。”</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Mr. Peters caught the leaves and put two of them carefully in his notecase. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>皮特斯先生抓住叶子，将其中两片小心地放进他的钱夹。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>When he looked up the swan was sailing about in the middle of the water again, flicking the drops angrily down its long neck.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>当他抬起头时，那只天鹅又在水中央游来游去了，它愤怒地泼洒着水，水滴沿着它长长的脖子流下。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Mr. Peters stood for some minutes reflecting on how he should use his reward. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>皮特斯先生站了几分钟，考虑他应该如何使用他的奖赏。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>He knew very well that the gift of three magic wishes was one which brought trouble more often than not, and he had no intention of being like the forester who first wished by mistake for a sausage, and then in a rage wished it on the end of his wife's nose, and then had to use his last wish in getting it off again. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>他非常清楚三个魔法愿望是个常常带来麻烦的礼物，他可不愿像那个林务官，第一个愿望弄错了要了根香肠，愤怒之下又许愿它长在他妻子的鼻子尖上，然后不得不用他最后一个愿望再次将它取下来。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Mr. Peters had most of the things which he wanted and was very content with his life. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>皮特斯先生想要的东西大都已经有了，他对自己的生活也很满意。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>The only thing that troubled him was that he was a little lonely, and had no companion for his old age. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>唯一一件让他烦心的事是他有点孤单，老时无伴。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>He decided to use his first wish and to keep the other two in case of an emergency. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>他决定使用他的第一个愿望，保存另两个愿望以备不时之需。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Taking a thorn he pricked his tongue with it, to remind himself not to utter rash wishes aloud. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>他拿起一根荆棘刺了一下他的舌头，提醒自己不要大声说出轻率的愿望。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Then holding the third leaf and gazing round him at the dusky undergrowth, the primroses, great beeches and the blue-green water of the canal, he said:</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>然后手拿第三片叶子，凝视着周围黑暗的灌木丛、报春花、高大的山毛榉树和运河里青绿色的水，他说：</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>"I wish I had a wife as beautiful as the forest."</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>“我希望有一个美如森林的妻子。”</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>A tremendous quacking and splashing broke out on the surface of the water. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>水面上猛地发出一声巨大的嘎嘎声和水的泼溅声。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>He thought that it was the swan laughing at him. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>他想是那只天鹅在嘲笑他。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Taking no notice he made his way through the darkening woods to his car, wrapped himself up in the rug and went to sleep.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>他没有理会，穿过变暗的树林回到车上，裹上毛毯睡了。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>When he awoke it was morning and the birds were beginning to call. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>当他醒来时，已是早晨了，鸟开始叫了。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Coming along the track towards him was the most beautiful creature he had ever seen, with eyes as blue-green as the canal, hair as dusky as the bushes, and skin as white as the feathers of swans.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>沿着道路向他走来的是他曾见过的最美丽的生物，眼睛如运河般青绿，头发如灌木丛般漆黑，皮肤如天鹅羽毛般洁白。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>"Are you the wife that I wished for?" asked Mr. Peters.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>“你是我许愿要的妻子吗？”皮特斯先生问道。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>"Yes I am," she replied. "My name is Leita."</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>“是的，我是，”她答道，“我叫蕾塔。”</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>She stepped into the car beside him and they drove off to the church on the outskirts of the forest, where they were married. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>她上了车，坐在他旁边，他们开车去森林边上的教堂，在那里他们结了婚。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Then he took her to his house in a remote and lovely valley and showed her all his treasures--the bees in their white hives, theJerseycows, the hyacinths, the silver candlesticks, the blue cups and the lustre bowl for putting primroses in. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>然后他带她去他坐落在一个偏远而秀美的山谷里的房子，向她展示他所有的财产——白色蜂房里的蜜蜂、泽西种奶牛、风信子、银烛台、蓝色的杯子和种植报春花的光亮的花盆。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>She admired everything, but what pleased her most was the river which ran by the foot of his garden.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>她对一切都很赞赏，但最让她高兴的是那条从他花园脚下流过的河。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>"Do swans come up here?" she asked.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>“天鹅来这里吗？”她问。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>"Yes, I have often seen swans there on the river," he told her, and she smiled.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>“来，我经常在河里见到天鹅，”他对她说，她脸上露出了笑容。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Leita made him a good wife. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>蕾塔是个好妻子。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>She was gentle and friendly, busied herself about the house and garden, polished the bowls, milked the cows and mended his socks. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>她温和友好，在房里花园忙里忙外，擦碗、给奶牛挤奶、给他补袜子。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>But as time went by Mr. Peters began to feel that she was not happy. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>但是随着时间的流逝，皮特斯先生开始感觉到她不快乐。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>She seemed restless, wandered much in the garden, and sometimes when he came back from the fields he would find the house empty and she would only return after half an hour or so with no explanation of where she had been. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>她似乎很不安，经常在花园里徘徊，有时他从田里回来时，他会发现房子里空无一人，大约半个小时后她才会回来，也不解释她去了哪里。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>On these occasions she was always especially tender and would put out his slippers to warm and cook his favourite dish--Welsh rarebit with wild strawberries--for supper.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>在这样的时候她总是特别温柔，她会拿出他的拖鞋暖一暖，烧他最喜欢的菜——野草莓威尔士兔——作晚餐。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>One evening he was returning home along the river path when he saw Leita in front of him, down by the water. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>一天傍晚他正沿着河边的路回家时看到蕾塔在他前面，在下面的水边上。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>A swan had sailed up to the verge and she had her arms round its neck and the swan's head rested against her cheek. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>一只天鹅游到了河边，她的胳膊环绕着它的脖子，天鹅的头靠在她的脸颊上。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>She was weeping, and as he came nearer he saw that tears were rolling, too, from the swan's eyes.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>她在哭泣，当他走得更近时他看到眼泪也在从天鹅的眼睛里滚落。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>"Leita, what is it?" he asked, very troubled.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>“蕾塔，这是什么？”他问道，感到非常不安。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>"This is my sister," she answered. "I can't bear being separated from her."</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>“这是我妹妹，”她答道，“我无法忍受和她分开。”</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Now he understood that Leita was really a swan from the forest, and this made him very sad because when a human being marries a bird it always leads to sorrow.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>现在他明白了蕾塔其实是森林里的一只天鹅，这使他很伤心，因为人类和鸟结婚总是导致悲剧。</seg>

<seg>"I could use my second wish to give your sister human shape, so that she could be a companion to you," he suggested.</seg>

<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>"Yes, I do, I do love you," she said, and there were tears in her eyes again. "But I miss the old life in the forest, the cool grass and the mist rising off the river at sunrise and the feel of the water sliding over my feathers as my sister and I drifted along the stream."</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>“爱，我真的、真的爱你，”她说，她的眼里又有眼泪了，“但是我想念在森林里的旧日生活，那清凉的草地、日出时从河面上升起的晨雾，还有我和妹妹沿着河流漂游时水滑过我的羽毛的感觉。”</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
