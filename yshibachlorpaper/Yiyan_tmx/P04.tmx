<seg>But despite Moira's words, neither she nor Henry had tried to move the girls back to their own beds while Colleen was gone; among the many small betrayals that Henry had committed as a father, depriving his daughters of this small sense of security would have loomed large. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>但尽管莫伊拉是这么说的，无论是她还是亨利都没有想法子让孩子们在科琳离家的时候搬回自己的卧室。作为爸爸，亨利已经在不少小事上哄骗了女儿们，与之相比，剥夺她们这一点点安全感似乎更让他不好受。</seg>

<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Besides, he did not mind sleeping in the same bed with his daughters; their presence, the gentle weight of their bodies, their hot sticky breath on his neck, was comforting to him in a way that his wife's presence had never been. </seg>

<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>此外，他并不介意和女儿们睡在一张床上；她们的存在，她们身体的小小重量，脖颈上感受到她们热乎乎的呼吸，这些都带给他一种舒适感，而这是妻子睡在他身边时他所未感受到的。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>No, sleeping with them was not the problem; instead, the actual process of getting the girls to fall asleep was the torment for Henry. </seg>

<seg>Tilly, barely 3, shifting against him, kicking at him, talking to her doll, and then the grunting- her porcine grunting rising in volume until he had to threaten to take away her monkey blanket- and Karen, almost 5 but with a teenager's penchant for exaggerated sighs, hands roving over his face, touching his eyes, his ears, no matter how many times he took her wrist and laid her arms flat against her body; that 30 or 40 minutes of trying to get them to go to sleep every night made him doubt his ability to raise his children without violence.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>刚刚三岁的蒂莉在他身边磨来蹭去，用脚踢他，和她的洋娃娃聊天，还不时地哼哼，她那像小猪似地哼哼声越来越吵，直到亨利不得不吓唬她说要拿走她的小猴毛毯；卡伦快五岁了，却像个十来岁的孩子一样喜欢夸张的手势，她的小手在亨利脸上摸来摸去，一会摸他的眼睛，一会揪他的耳朵；亨利只好一次又一次地握住她的小手腕，把她的胳膊平放回身体两侧。每天晚上都要花上三、四十分钟来哄她们睡觉，亨利开始怀疑自己不用武力就能把孩子们养大的能力。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Still, the torment was worth it for the precious few minutes he had with them when they were neither awake nor asleep, when they were finally still and their breath began to flatten out in rhythmic heaviness, when their bodies fell slack and rolled in toward him, toward the black-hole depression that he occupied in the middle of the mattress. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>尽管如此，当女儿们终于静下来，呼吸变得平稳，开始有节奏地一呼一吸；当她们小小的身子放松了，脸朝向他，或者说朝向他在床上压出来的凹陷处蜷成一团，她们半睡半醒，这宝贵的几分钟使得之前的折磨变得可以忍受。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>They always fell asleep within seconds of each other, and he often wondered if some magic formula could make them fall asleep more quickly, say, in three or four minutes, instead of the better part of an agonizing hour.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>她们总是前后差不上个几秒钟就一起睡着，而亨利常常纳闷是不是有什么神奇配方可以让女儿们更快地入睡，比方说，三、四分钟之内，而不是令人痛苦的接近一个小时。</seg>

<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>等到蒂利和卡伦睡着了，亨利总是小心翼翼地爬下床，尽管他知道他的小心有些夸张，这个时候他的撤退恐怕很难惊动两个孩子，要想吵醒她们，那得要更大的动静才行。</seg>

<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Karen occasionally talked in her sleep, muttering and mumbling, no words that he could decipher, the language of somnolence. </seg>

<seg>卡伦有时会说梦话，嘟嘟囔囔的，亨利一个词也听不出：梦之国的语言。</seg>
