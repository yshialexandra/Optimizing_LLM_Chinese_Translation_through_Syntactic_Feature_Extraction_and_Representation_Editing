<seg>The girl on the hill made Mark think of Edna St. Vincent Millay. </seg>

<seg>山头的女孩让马克想到了埃德娜·圣文森特·米莱。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Perhaps it was because of the way she was standing there in the afternoon sun, her dandelion-hued hair dancing in the wind; perhaps it was because of the way her old-fashioned white dress was swirling around her long and slender legs. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>这也许是因为她那在夕阳前任由蒲公英花色的头发随风舞动的身姿；也许是因为她那旧式连衣裙裙摆缠绕着她修长双腿的模样。</seg>

<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>In any event, he got the definite impression that she had somehow stepped out of the past and into the present; and that was odd, because as things turned out, it wasn't the past she had stepped out of, but the future.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>不论怎样，他都清楚地感觉到，她似乎是从过去穿越到现在的。这事儿说来也怪，因为不久后他便知道，她所来之处并非过去，而是将来。</seg>

<seg>He paused some distance behind her, breathing hard from the climb. </seg>

<seg>While he was trying to make up his mind, he took out his pipe and filled and lighted it, cupping his hands over the bowl and puffing till the tobacco came to glowing life. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>他一边要下定决心，一边拿出烟斗、填入烟丝点了火，然后弓起手挡在烟斗口前，吸了几口气，直到烟丝微微地发出光来。</seg>

<seg>When he looked at her again, she had turned around and was regarding him curiously.</seg>

<seg>He had been tramping through woods when he came to the hill, and now the woods lay behind and far below him, burning gently with the first pale fires of fall, and beyond the woods lay the little lake with its complement of cabin and fishing pier. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>来这座小山丘的路上，他已经徒步穿过了一片树林。而现在，那片树林已经在他脚下很远了。它们像是在秋天的第一场暗火中静静燃烧着。更远处，则是一座小湖，湖边建有一座小木屋和一处钓台。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>When his wife had been unexpectedly summoned for jury duty, he had been forced to spend alone the two weeks he had saved out of his summer vacation and he had been leading a lonely existence, fishing off the pier by day and reading the cool evenings away before the big fireplace in the raftered living room; and after two days the routine had caught up to him, and he had taken off into the woods without purpose or direction and finally he had come to the hill and had climbed it and seen the girl.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>由于妻子意外地被招入陪审团，他只得独自度过从暑假挤出来的两周时间：白天在钓台钓鱼，晚上则在起居室的大壁炉前读书度过寒夜。按这套程序做了两天后，他开始走出小屋，在树林里漫无目的地游荡，最终来到这座小山丘，爬上去后遇见了这个女孩。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Her eyes were blue, he saw when he came up to her- as blue as the sky that framed her slender silhouette. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>他已走近了她，看到了她湛蓝的双眸——就像那映衬出她纤瘦的身影的天空一样蓝。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Her face was oval and young and soft and sweet. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>她的鹅蛋脸年轻、柔和、而又甜美，让他心生悸动、感到似曾相识。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>It evoked a deja vu so poignant that he had to resist an impulse to reach out and touch her wind-kissed cheek; and even though his hand did not leave his side, he felt his fingertips tingle.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>他压抑住想要抚摩她那清风吹拂的面庞的冲动：尽管没有伸出手去，但他仍觉得指尖有隐隐的刺痛。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Why, I'm forty-four, he thought wonderingly, and she's hardly more than twenty. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>他心里一阵恐慌：怎么搞得，我都已经四十四了，而她基本上还没有二十岁。</seg>

<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>"Are you enjoying the view?" he asked aloud.</seg>

<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>他大声地问了句：“你喜欢这风景吗？”</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>"Oh, yes," she said and turned and swept her arm in an enthusiastic semicircle. "Isn't it simply marvelous!" </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>“哦，是的。”她转回身去，用手划了一个夸张的半圈，“简直叫人不可思议！”</seg>

<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Below them the woods began again, then spread out over the lowlands in warm September colors, embracing a small hamlet several miles away, finally bowing out before the first outposts of the suburban frontier. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>树林在他们的脚下继续向外延伸，以一片九月的温暖的秋色，覆盖了整块低地，怀抱着几英里外的一个小村庄，最终止于这城郊边缘的第一爿村落前。</seg>

</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>In the far distance, haze softened the serrated silhouette of Cove City, lending it the aspect of a sprawling medieval castle, making it less of a reality than a dream. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>更远处，雾霭中柔和地显现出科沃城的轮廓，看上去就像绵延不断的中世纪城堡一般，如梦如幻。</seg>

<seg>"Are you from the city too?" he asked.</seg>
</tuv>

</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">

<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>“也可以这么说吧。”</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>She smiled at him. "I'm from the Cove City of two hundred and forty years from now."</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>她冲他笑着说，“我是从两百四十年后的科沃城来的。”</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>The smile told him that she didn't really expect him to believe her, but it implied that it would be nice if he would pretend. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>这一展笑容告诉他，她并不真的期望他会相信，但似乎又在希望他能够假装如此。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>He smiled back. "That would be A.D. twenty-two hundred and one, wouldn't it?" he said. "I imagine the place has grown enormously by then."</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>他也笑着回应道：“那也就是2201年了，对吧？我猜那个时候这里肯定变得非常大了。”</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>"Oh, it has," she said. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>“嗯，没错。</seg>

<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>"It's part of a megalopolis now and extends all the way to there." </seg>

<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>这儿变成了大城市的一部分，一直延伸到那里。”</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>She pointed to the fringe of the forest at their feet. "Two Thousand and Fortieth Street runs straight through that grove of sugar maples," she went on, "and do you see that stand of locusts over there?"</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>她指着他们脚下森林的边缘，“2040大街笔直地穿过那片糖槭林。然后，你看到那边的洋槐了没？”</seg>

<seg>If it was, it was because she made it so. </seg>

</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>"The reason is because the machine is affected by the passage of time the same as anything else, and you have to set it back every twenty-four hours if you want to maintain exactly the same co-ordinate. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>这是因为时光机器和世间万物一样，会受到时间流逝的影响。如果你想精确保证相同的坐标，就得每二十四个小时把它回调一次。</seg>
