<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>For a long time after her husband died, Marina used to scream. She'd feel the scream rushing up from her stomach, choking her from the inside, and she'd run out of the room, stumbling over her kids' toys, and hide in the hallway, in the narrow space between the coatrack and the mirror stand, biting down on her right forearm to muffle the sound. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>玛丽娜在她丈夫去世后很长的一段时间里常常会尖声叫喊，她感到尖叫声冲出腹部堵在胸口，于是她跌跌撞撞穿过孩子们丢在地上的玩具奔出房间。她躲在衣帽架和穿衣镜之间狭小的空间里，用牙齿咬着自己的手臂来抑制尖叫声。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>After the scream had passed, and she unclenched her teeth, there would be little circular marks on her arm that looked like irregular postage stamps. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>直到尖叫完毕她才会松开牙齿，在手臂上留下小小的圆形齿印像是一张不规则的邮票。</seg>

<seg>Those scars remained long after Marina had stopped screaming, long after she had ceased grieving for her husband altogether.</seg>
