<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>When my marriage fell apart one summer, I had to get out of the little flat in Kentish Town, where I had been first happy and then sad. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>那年夏天我的婚姻破裂后，我不得不从肯迪什镇的那套小公寓里搬出去，在这套公寓里，我最先很开心，后来却变得很伤心。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>I arranged to live for a few months in another woman's house; she agreed to let me stay there rent-free, because she was going to America and wanted someone to keep an eye on things. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>我计划到另一个女人的房子里住几个月，她同意我住在她家，而且不收我房租，因为她要去美国，希望有人照看家中的东西。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>I didn't know Hana very well; she was a friend of a friend. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>韩娜只是我朋友的朋友，我不是很了解她。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>I found her intimidating- she was tall and big-boned and gushing, with a high forehead and a curvaceous strong jaw, a mass of chestnut-colored curls. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>我觉得她有些令人生畏——身材高大，说话煽情，高高的前额，厚实但性感的下巴，还有浓密的栗色卷发。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>But I liked the idea of having her three-story red brick London town house all to myself.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>可是，我喜欢一人享受她这栋在伦敦市区的三层红砖房子。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>She was generous when we met to sort out arrangements, telling me to make myself at home, entertain my friends, use her iMac and her Wi-Fi, help myself to anything I needed in the kitchen, and sleep in her bed. ("The bed's wonderfully comfortable," she said.) </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>我和她碰面安排事情时，她很慷慨大方，告诉我别客气，尽管在家里招待朋友，让我用她的iMac和Wi-Fi,厨房里的东西也让我尽管用，还让我睡她的床——她说：“那张床很舒服。”</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>A woman would come in twice a week to clean, and I didn't have to pay for that, either. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>一个女工每周会来打扫两次，而且我也不用付钱。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>We sat at the counter in Hana's kitchen, drinking coffee and eating baklava from a cardboard box- left over from a dinner party the night before, along with the remains of a salad, wilting in its dressing, glasses with dregs of red wine by the sink, the taint of cigarette smoke. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>我和韩娜坐在她的厨房柜台前，喝着咖啡，吃着纸盒里的果仁蜜饼——前一天晚上晚宴剩下的，盘子里还剩着调好味的蔫沙拉，水槽里放着些还剩着红酒的杯子，还有些烟灰。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Hana had just showered, and her damp hair was twisted in a clip on top of her head; her heated skin gave off the strong smell of her perfume or her shower gel. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>韩娜刚洗完澡，她把湿头发盘起来别在头上，温热的肌肤发出浓浓的香水味，或者是沐浴露香。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>A crumb of baklava stuck to her mouth. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>她口里咬着一小块蜜饼。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>I guessed that she was in her early forties: the flesh was puffy under her eyes and at the corners of her lips; she might have had work done on her nose. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>我猜测，她应该四十出头：眼下和唇角都有些鼓胀；她可能给鼻子整过容。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>I was twenty-eight, and she made me feel inexperienced, although I had been married for six years. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>我才二十八岁，虽然已经结婚六年，但她却让我觉得自己阅历不够。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>She wore a bright-yellow kimono embroidered with a dragon, and a heavy ivory bangle on her wrist. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>她穿着鲜黄色的和服，和服上面绣着一条龙，她手上还戴着一只粗重的象牙手镯。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>"I know," she said guiltily, grimacing and twisting it on her arm when she thought I was staring at it. "I shouldn't wear it; it's a sin. But it's an antique. I tell myself that these elephants would be long dead anyway."</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>“我知道，”她以为我在盯着手镯看，便做了个鬼脸，拧了拧手镯，内疚地说，“我不该戴的，真是罪过，不过这个是个古董，我告诉自己，反正这些大象很久前就死了的。”</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>There were no curtains on the windows of that house, not even in the bedrooms. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>她房子的窗户上没有窗帘，卧室里面都没有。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>At first, I found this unbearable. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>起初我觉得这无法忍受。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>I undressed for bed in the bathroom; I got into bed in the dark. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>睡觉前我跑到浴室里脱衣服，然后关了灯抹黑上床。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>But after a while I began to get used to it. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>可过了一久，我慢慢就习惯了。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>This was how Hana lived her life- flamboyantly on display, careless of who might be watching. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>韩娜就是这样生活的——夸张地展示自己，不管有没有人偷看。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>I didn't flatter myself that anyone was watching me. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>我不是炫耀说有人会偷看我。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Or if they were watching, they thought I was something I was not, so it didn't matter. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>或者就算有人看，他们联想到的我，也不是真正的我，所以也就无所谓了。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>They thought I was the owner of that house, with its big, bare rooms and wood floors and rugs and few, distinctive items of furniture: a retro armchair in tubular steel and black leather, a long glass-topped dining table, two antique mirrors framed with gilded cupids bearing rose garlands. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>他们觉我是房子的主人。这房子有许多空空的大房间，铺着木地板和地毯，还有几件特别的家具——一把钢管和黑色皮革制成的复古手扶椅、一张长长的玻璃面餐桌、两面古董镜子，镜框上有两个镀金的丘比特，手里拿着玫瑰花环。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>I've never had that kind of money, or anything like it. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>我从来没有过买这些东西的钱，也没有过类似的东西。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>I think Hana made her money by dealing in art- there were paintings on all the walls- though some of the phone calls that came for her seemed to be related to the film business.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>尽管有些打给韩娜的电话与电影圈有关，但我还是觉得韩娜靠艺术品挣钱——她家墙上全都挂着画。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>I moved in with the few boxes of things I'd salvaged from my marriage. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>我带着从婚姻里拯救的几箱东西，搬了进去。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>What I'd really wanted was to walk out of the flat with nothing, shedding it all behind me as cleanly as a skin. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>我本来是想两手空空离开那套公寓的，把一切都干干净净的抛到身后。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>The little collection of totems that I took with me everywhere- pebbles from a certain beach, a few framed photographs, my dead mother's empty perfume bottle- looked like rubbish when I spread them out in Hana's bedroom, so I hid them away again. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>我到任何地方都带着收集的图腾——某个海滩上捡到的卵石、几张加框的照片、我已经去世的母亲的空香水瓶。我把它们摆在韩娜的卧室里，可它们看起来像垃圾一样，我就又把它们收了藏起来。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>I told myself that this house was a good place for me, temporarily: this nowhere where I was nobody. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>我告诉自己，这房子于我，暂时是个好地方：在这个无名之地，我谁也不是。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>When the woman came in to clean, I went out and walked around on Primrose Hill or went to a museum, if it was raining- it rained a lot that summer. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>女工进来到扫，我就出去到樱草山散步，或者要是下雨的话——那年夏天雨很多——就去博物馆。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>My husband had given me some money in exchange for my share of the things we'd bought together (fridge, television, sofa, bed), and I was trying to make it last as long as possible. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>至于我和我丈夫共同买的那些东西，像冰箱、电视、沙发、床，他给了我一笔钱作为交换，我试着把笔钱花得尽量久一些。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Hana had told me to help myself to what was in the freezer, so I ate through the odds and ends of food she had in there, including things I'd never tasted before- veal saltimbocca, shrimp in teriyaki sauce, and jerk chicken. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>韩娜告诉我尽管享用冰箱里的东西，所以我把她留下的东西都吃了个遍，包括之前没有尝过的——牛肉卷、日式浇汁虾、熏烤鸡肉。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>When the money runs out, I thought, I'll start looking for work.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>我想，等到这笔钱用完了，我就要开始找工作。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>On rainy days, I wandered from room to room in that big house, cocooned by the rushing, persistent sound of the rain sluicing across the slate roof, overflowing in the gutters and downpipes. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>下雨天时，我在这栋大房子里，从一间房晃悠到另外一间。雨水从板岩屋顶冲刷下来，装满下水道和落水管，发出奔腾持久的声音，把我包围起来。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>At midday, the light outside was blue, and the panes in the tall windows seemed liquefied; I switched on all the lamps. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>到中午时，外面的光线变成蓝色，高达窗户的窗框好像被熔化了一般，我便打开了屋里所有的灯。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>I made myself coffee and carried it with me to the window, so that the steam from my mug misted the glass; the television flickered and capered, but I couldn't distract myself from the rain's urgency, as if it were something happening.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>我给自己煮了咖啡，端着咖啡站到窗边，让杯里的热气把玻璃变模糊。电视机画面闪烁跳跃，我还是不能把注意力从急促的雨中移开，就好像有事情发生一样。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>I had thought that I would forget about Hana once she was out of the house, but, moving around inside the shapes of her life, I found myself more powerfully impressed by her than I had been when she was present. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>我本来以为韩娜走了，我就会忘掉她，可是在她的生活模子里，我我对她的印象，比她在时还要有力。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>The wardrobes full of her clothes stood in for her: velvet trousers and brocade jackets, an evening dress of pleated chiffon with a sequinned bodice- everything padded and sculpted, each outfit a performance in itself.
</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>衣橱里全是她的衣服，在那儿代替她——丝绒裤子、锦缎夹克、褶皱的薄绸晚礼服，上身装饰着亮片。这一切放在那儿，装饰那儿的衣服，各自有其作用。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>There were attic rooms at the top of the house and one of these was locked. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>楼顶有几间阁楼，其中一间被锁着。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Hana had emptied out drawers and cupboards to make space for me, so I guessed that she had tidied everything personal away into this room. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>韩娜给我腾地方，清空了抽屉和橱柜，所以我想她把全部私人物品搬到了那间房间里。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>I came across the key accidentally, in a kitchen drawer beside some tea towels. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>在厨房抽屉里的抹布边上，我无意间发现了钥匙。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Those attic rooms had the original door fittings and this was a long iron key, like something in a novel or a pantomime. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>这些阁楼房间的门，还装这原有的锁具。这把钥匙是一把长长的金属钥匙，像小说或者童话剧里的一样。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>At the time, I hardly registered seeing it. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>那时我并没有在意看到了这把钥匙。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Then it began to weigh on my mind, and one afternoon, when I had nothing better to do, I took it upstairs to try it in the lock. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>可后来它在我脑中越来越重，然后一天中午，我没有什么事做，便拿起了它上楼，看看能不能打开那把锁。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>I feel ashamed of this now, needless to say. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>当然，现在想来是有些愧疚。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>I think I felt that because I was nobody my slipping inside Hana's privacy wouldn't count as a real intrusion. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>我当时应该是觉得自己谁也不是，溜进韩娜的私人房间里算不上真正的侵犯她的隐私。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>And she'd left the key lying around, hadn't she? </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>而且是她把钥匙放在那儿的，对吧？</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Anyway, I only meant to take a quick look.</seg>

<seg>反正我就只是打算很快看一看。</seg>

<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>The room was heaped surprisingly high with stuff, as if she'd been using it for storage for a long time. </seg>

<seg>房间里的东西，堆得出奇的高，似乎她用这房间存储东西很久了。</seg>
</tuv>

<seg>房间里堆着衣服、鞋、包。包里装着装饰品，还有我期待的旧化妆品。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>There were also paintings- speculations that hadn't paid off, perhaps?- propped, sometimes two or three deep, against the walls, their faces turned away as if in disgrace. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>房间里还有画靠在墙上——或许是投机买过来的，还没有卖掉？有些两三幅堆在一起，画面朝墙，像见不得人似的。</seg>
