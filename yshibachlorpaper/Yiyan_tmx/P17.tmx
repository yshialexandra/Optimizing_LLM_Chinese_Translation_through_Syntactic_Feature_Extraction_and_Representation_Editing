<seg>理查德又读了一会儿书。</seg>

<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>He was restless but tried to take an interest in Odysseus' journey to the home of his loyal "swineherd"- what a word, what a way to make a living!- who of course doesn't recognize him, nobody ever recognized anybody in these old books, but offers Odysseus a meal anyway and bangs his ear off with complaints. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>他焦躁不安，不过仍努力集中精神，关注着奥德修斯前往他忠诚“猪倌”家的旅程。“猪倌”？好一个词儿，好一个谋生的行当。“猪倌”当然不认识奥德修斯——这种老书里，谁都不认识谁——不过他还是让奥德修斯吃了一顿饭，对着他抱怨一通。</seg>

<seg>He leafed ahead to the part where Odysseus strings his bow and slaughters all the suitors, but there was a lot more fancy description and speechifying than he remembered from the version he'd read as a kid. </seg>

<seg>理查德觉得这章无聊、不合情理，便向后翻到奥德修斯拉弓杀掉所有求婚者的那一部分。不过比起小时读的那个版本，他现在读的这个版本里描写更为奇幻，言语更具气势。</seg>

<seg>He was supposed to have read it again, a couple years ago, as part of his freshman core at Columbia, but he'd come down with the flu that week.</seg>

<seg>几年前刚到哥伦比亚大学上学时，这本书是新生必读书目之一，他那时就应该重读的，不过那个星期他刚好患了流感，就与这本书失之交臂了。</seg>

</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>It was a library book. </seg>

<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>这是一本图书馆借来的书。</seg>

<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>He studied the withdrawal dates- few of them and far between- then closed it and put it back down.</seg>

<seg>Ana had only stirred a little when he turned on the lamp. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>理查德刚才打开台灯时，安娜只是轻轻动了一下。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Now he switched it off and plumped his pillow and fooled with the covers, hoping that all this would do the trick, but she slept on, snoring softly, face to the wall. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>现在，他关掉灯，拍了拍枕头，故意玩着枕巾，希望能把安娜弄醒，不过安娜还是熟睡着，面对着墙，轻声打着鼾。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>The bed was narrow, and in the dark he became even more aware of the heat from her back and her legs, especially her legs. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>床并不宽，再加上关了灯，理查德更能感受到安娜背部和双腿，特别是双腿，散发出的热量。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>He touched his knee to the tender crook of hers and she drew away, leaving him jangly and resentful, but conscious also that he had no right to be, that she'd already given herself twice that night and had to get up early with a full day of waitressing ahead of her; he had only one class to attend, in the afternoon. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>他用膝盖去碰安娜的腿弯，可安娜挪了挪，避开了他。他有些生气，但是他也晓得，他不应该这样，安娜这晚已经和他云雨了两次，而且明天还要早起，在餐馆做服务员，整整工作一天。而他只有一节课，还是在下午。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>But knowing this did not take the edge off his need- for it felt like need, nothing less- to have her against him again, her open mouth moving on his, her fingers digging into his back.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>尽管这样，他对安娜的需要——就是需要，不是其它的——没有丝毫减弱，他需要安娜转过身来，手指扣到自己的背里面，张开香唇和自己激吻。</seg>

</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>可想什么呢？</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Even thinking of something else, he'd know that he was doing it to distract himself, and that thought would lead right back to this bed, to the weight of Ana beside him, her breath, her heat. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>就是想着其它的事情，他也知道自己是为了转移注意力，然后思绪又会马上回到床上，回到身边的安娜身上，想着她的呼吸、她的体温。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Still, if he kept it up long enough maybe he'd fall asleep, or at least be awake and ready when her alarm went off. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>话说回来，他要是一直想，想久了也许也能睡着。或者也可以一直醒着，等着安娜的闹钟响时和她恩爱一番。</seg>

<tu>

<seg>Not that he'd pressure her. </seg>

<seg>他不会强迫安娜。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Unless they hurried, which she didn't like, she'd have to go to work without breakfast or a shower. </seg>

<seg>如果不是匆忙完事的话（安娜不喜欢这样），安娜就得饿着肚子，不洗澡就去上班。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>He'd just give her a look, his special look, and she'd know, and then she could do whatever she wanted. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>他只需看着安娜，用特别的眼神看着安娜，安娜就知到他的想法，与不与他恩爱都全则由她做主。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>And he wouldn't act hurt if she didn't want to. </seg>

<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>安娜若是不想，他也不会表现出伤心委屈。</seg>

<seg>理查德之前看过电影，电影里那个魔鬼附身的女孩，脑袋在脖子上面转动得像陀螺一样，不过理查德那时还不知道电影改编自这本书——这本书又不是什么文学名著之类的。</seg>

</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>安娜低声哼了哼，动了动身子，又煽动出一阵温热，一阵她睡觉时的温暖甜蜜的体香，就像烤面包的香味一样。他紧张不安地躺着等待，可是安娜再没有移动身体。</seg>
