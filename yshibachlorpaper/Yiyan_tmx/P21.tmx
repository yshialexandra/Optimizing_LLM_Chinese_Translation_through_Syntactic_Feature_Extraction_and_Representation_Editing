<seg>I know that this is a very ordinary thing to do. And I know now that lecturers, when they notice yet another smitten girl-child traipsing moonily around after them, simply sigh and feel anxious. </seg>

<seg>其实我觉得这没什么，而且我心里清楚得很，当这些老师们意识到又一个被他的魅力所倾倒的姑娘开始神魂颠倒地在他们身边游弋的时候，他们会有些焦灼。</seg>

<seg>His name was Patrick Hammett, and he taught courses on Shakespeare, seventeenth-century poetry, and critical theory. </seg>

<seg>In a crowd, in a club, you wouldn't have picked him out as particularly good-looking. But in the lecture room, sitting with us in the democratic circle of chairs that he insisted upon, his looks were a power, a force that I felt physically, like velvet against my skin. </seg>

<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">

<seg>I don't remember now what season of the year it was, but I do remember that the fluorescent lights in the lecture room were on in the middle of the day because the sky was so dark outside, navy-blue clouds pressing close to the earth like an artificial ceiling. </seg>

<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>我不太记得那堂课是在什么时候上的了，但我清楚记得那天中午教室里的荧光灯开着，因为外面的天空很暗，深蓝色的云朵匍匐在地面上，像一面人造天花板。</seg>

<seg>Little gouts of rain were spitting against the window, and in the gently sloping field outside (the campus was built up around an eighteenth-century house on an estate farmed by the Duchy of Cornwall) the bullocks, instead of lying down as they should have done with rain coming, were jostling uneasily and heaving up against the fence and clambering onto one another's backs.</seg>

<seg>When I look at the poem now, I see that it is the lament of a much older man for a young wife snatched away by death, and that it depends upon a confidence in the resurrection of the body on Judgment Day. </seg>

<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>当我再看这首诗的时候，我感受到了一位年纪很大的老人对于年轻妻子被死神夺去生命的哀痛，以及那种坚信最后审判日，妻子会最终复活的信心。</seg>

<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>I don't know anything about those things. But at the time I felt that the words of the poem were so immediate and relevant that they spoke to me not just through my mind but through my body. </seg>

<seg>Patrick was never allowed, for example, to tell me that he had always loved me, that he had been fascinated by me from the moment I first walked into the lecture room.

<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>帕特里克在这些幻想中从来不会告诉我，他很早之前就爱上了我，在我迈进教室的那一瞬间就为我神魂颠倒——不会，我的幻想只不过是：他对一个有趣的学生很欣赏，对我进行一种智力上的引导。</seg>

<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>He had to be surprised out of his position of friendly neutrality and into a dawning, uneasy recognition of his growing attraction to me, an attraction that he perhaps couldn't quite rationally account for. </seg>

<seg>比如说，他会突然对自己和我保持朋友关系感到挫败，在一个清晨，他终于意识到对我产生了无法抑制的爱慕，对我怀有一种无法用理性来承担的吸引力。</seg>

<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>The transformation could be precipitated in various ways; these were the only extravagance I allowed myself. Sometimes we would be accidentally stranded by a breakdown in the middle of nowhere, after he'd innocently offered me a ride home from college. Or we'd be caught by a freak storm when stopping by the cottage of a friend of his to pick up some books. Or he would have to take refuge in my room one night after being beaten up by muggers and left bleeding in the road just as I was on my way home.</seg>
