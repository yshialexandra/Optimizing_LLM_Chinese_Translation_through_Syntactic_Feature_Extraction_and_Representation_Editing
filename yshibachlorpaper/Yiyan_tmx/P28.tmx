<seg>They had lied to each other so many times, over so many years, that deceptions between them had become commonplace, practically repertoire. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>多年来，他们相互撒谎很多次，相互欺骗也成为常事，几乎成了他们间的全部节目。</seg>

<seg>Everyone knew this about them--it wasn't news among their friends. </seg>

<seg>关于这点，所有人都知道，更不是他们朋友圈里的新闻。</seg>

<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>That night, they had dinner reservations with Elliot and Susan, who were accustomed to following the shifts in attitude and tone--Kate's theatrical sighs, for instance, in reaction to Jim's mournful looks across the table at her--brought on by the strain of living in an atmosphere of worry and betrayal. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>那晚，他们预定了位置，要和艾略特、苏珊共进晚餐。艾略特和苏珊已经习惯了关注他俩态度和语气的转变。比如凯特的夸张叹息，就是回应吉姆隔着桌子看她的忧伤眼神。吉姆这种眼神，又是因为生活在不忠和烦恼的紧张气氛里十分紧张。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>It was winter, and dark, and the air in their little apartment was dry and nauseatingly warm; and yet what they needed, it seemed to Jim, was not to flee their home for another night of exciting conversational pauses and sly four-way flirting. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>正值冬天傍晚，他们狭小公寓里空气干燥，温暖得令人作呕。然而对于吉姆来说，他们想要的不是从家逃离，晚上坐到一起，兴奋地谈话、休息；也不是四个人各怀心思，相互调情。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>They needed to sit down together, no matter how stuffy it got in the living room, no matter how loudly the radiators hissed and banged, and take turns speaking their minds. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>他们需要的是，不管客厅里有多闷，不理散热器发出的嘶嘶砰砰声有多吵，都坐到一起，轮流说出自己的心声。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>They had to talk. </seg>

<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>他们必须得谈谈。</seg>

<seg>But first he would stop at the florist's on his way home from the outpatient clinic. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>但首先，在从门诊诊所回家的路上，他准备在花店停一会儿。</seg>

<seg>他要是抱着花束走进门，凯特脸上可能会露出微笑。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>There was a chance also that it wouldn't look awkward or strange when, at the end of the evening--he didn't really believe that he and Kate would be staying in--he paired with Susan for the walk through the cold, from the restaurant to Elliot's car. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>也有另外一种可能——晚宴结束后（吉姆确信他们晚上不会呆在家里不出去），他携着凯特穿过寒风，从餐厅走向艾略特的汽车时，看上去不至于尴尬，奇怪。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>It might look, in other words, as if he were not bothered by Kate's whispering to another man. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>也可能让自己看起来好像并未因凯特与另外一个男人耳语而困扰。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>(She had a way, with Elliot, of bowing her head and mumbling furiously through the strands of hair that fell across the side of her face, so that, in order to make out her words, Elliot was forced to stoop and lean into the fog of her breath.) </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>凯特与艾略特讲话时，习惯低着头，头发滑下遮在脸侧，说话叽叽咕咕，语速又快。为了听清楚凯特的话，艾略特不得不屈身，把头偏进凯特呼出的热气里。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Jim's own affair, his affair with Susan, had been over for almost five months, long enough, he thought, as he approached the florist's on the corner by his and Kate's building, for him to begin experimenting--later that same night, if the mood was right--with innocently putting his arm around Susan's shoulder while she and he and Kate and Elliot walked in two sets of two toward the parking garage.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>吉姆自己与苏珊的恋情，已经结束快五个月了。他觉得够久了。想着，他已经快到花店了，就在他和凯特所住楼房的拐角。晚上迟些时候，如果心情不错的话，他要开始他的实验——苏珊与他，凯特与艾略特，成双成对走向停车场时，他要单纯地搂住苏珊的肩膀。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Of course, he wanted to be careful not to punish Kate, or, at least, not to seem to punish her, for her success in adultery. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>当然，他只是想表现得细心些，并非因为凯特不忠而想惩罚她，至少看起来不像是惩罚她。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Elliot made her laugh--in a sweet way. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>艾略特逗苏珊笑，方法甜蜜。</seg>

<seg>他已经到达花店。花店里，他直接走向装玫瑰的冷柜。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Though it was a cold day, cold and very windy, and he'd come in chilled, the short walk across the heated space warmed him, and he could feel the frigid air hit him in the face when he yanked open the glass door. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>天气很冷，风很大，他走进来时已经冻透了。但是在有暖气的屋内走了短短几步，他便暖和起来，猛然拉开冷柜玻璃门，还能感觉到冷气铺面而来。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>He leaned in and peered at the flowers. He asked the girl, "Do you have yellow roses that haven't already bloomed and, you know, opened?"</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>他俯身看着玫瑰花，问那女孩：“有没有还没绽放的黄玫瑰？你知道，就是还没开放的。”</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Yellow roses, signifying friendship more than eros, seemed right, given the complex potentials of the evening.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>黄玫瑰更多时候象征友爱，而非情爱。鉴于晚上有各种可能性，十分复杂，所以黄玫瑰似乎比较合适。</seg>

<seg>Kate, in the meantime, was upstairs in the apartment, talking on the phone to Elliot. The call had gone on for more than five hours. </seg>

<seg>与此同时，凯特在楼上公寓里，正和艾略特打电话，已经打了五个多小时。</seg>

<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>她不得不用尽所有能用的电话。她用了自己的手机。之前还用了公寓里两部便宜的无绳电话，一部在厨房，一部在卧室。</seg>

</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Carrying that phone (her first of the call), she'd gone into the bedroom, picked up its brother from the night table, and said, into this new phone, "Are you there? Can you hear me?

</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>她拿着电话（她最先用的就是这部）走进卧室，从床头柜上拾起另一部电话——厨房里那部的兄弟。然后对着新电话说：“你还在吗？能听得见吗？等等我挂掉那电话。”说完，她便拿着两个电话走进厨房，把没电的那部挂到墙上底座里。</seg>

<seg>Kate opened and closed this empty cabinet several times while explaining, on the bedroom phone, why Elliot's being married and her being married shouldn't necessarily be considered something they had in common. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>凯特打开空橱柜的门，然后又关上，反反复复。同时又对着卧室里那部电话向艾略特解释，为什么绝对不能把艾略特和她都已婚视为他们的共同之处。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>That they were both childless could stand as an area of emotional parity, she felt, considering the fact that they both remained unsure as to whether to have children, while their spouses frequently made it clear that, in their opinions--Susan's specifically regarding Elliot, Jim's specifically regarding Kate, and neither Susan nor Jim meaning to suggest a marital reconfiguration--they'd make "a great dad" or "a great mom."</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>凯特觉得她和艾略特都没有孩子是情感上的平等。他们俩都还不确定要不要孩子，但是他们的伴侣——艾略特指的是苏珊，凯特指的是吉姆，都没有指自己是对方的伴侣——总是明说要作个“好爸爸”、“好妈妈”。</seg>

<seg>But the business of swapping phones, the walking from room to room in the stuffy apartment, had, as it were, weakened her. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>但是在沉闷的公寓房间走来走去，不停地更换电话，可以说已经让她清醒过来。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>

<seg>It was as if, in losing that first phone, she'd lost a line of defense, however symbolic, against Elliot's desire. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>似乎第一次电话断线时，她对于艾略特欲望的防线也断了。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Or maybe, she thought as she stood in the kitchen, opening and closing the dumbwaiter door with one hand, the necessary act of sacrificing one phone for another could be read as a veiled enactment of the sort of ambivalence required for alternating between lovers in the first place. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>又或者，当她站在厨房，单手开关着升降机门时，她想的是，牺牲一部电话，再换用另一部，可以解读为一种模糊的演绎，演绎她从一开始轮换于两个情人之间产生的矛盾心理。</seg>

<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Or was that too absurd?</seg>

<seg>“是我。”凯特说道，然后用痛苦的声音告诉艾略特，她家里的电话全没电了，她现在用着她手机，刚才正想说她一点都不喜欢不诚实的做法。</seg>

</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>她把电话听筒摁到耳朵上，然后从卧室走到客厅，再走到厨房，然后径直走下走廊，走向公寓的狭小前厅。途中路过极小的第二洗手间，里面的马桶已经坏掉，不能用了。</seg>
