<seg>一些快乐的事</seg>

<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>The first time I saw Arthur McKechnie, he came into the bank with some checks. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>我第一次见到亚瑟麦凯尔彻妮时，他正拿着几张支票走进银行。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>I had just started working there, fresh out of school and a bit nervous, I suppose, and I liked the way he behaved, all polite and quietly spoken, which was more than I could have said for some of the other customers. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>当时，我刚从学校毕业，开始在那里工作，难免有几分紧张，不过我想，我喜欢他的行事风格，对他有几分好感，他谈吐文雅，语气温和，我感觉他与别的客户完全不同。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>By the end of that first, almost wordless transaction, I had already decided he was someone I could like, but I had also noticed that he was a bit too different, one of those men who think too much about stuff that nobody else bothers with, or don't pay enough attention to other people to understand what they might do, when push comes to shove. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>他第一次来办理业务时，几乎一言未语，办完业务后，我便觉得他是我喜欢的那种人，但我也注意到，他有些过于与众不同，属于那种太在意别人都不在乎的事情的人，但是当面对突如其来的意外，在十分紧要的时刻，对那些别人都知道如何去应对事情他却显得心不在焉。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>As he stood there with the pen in his hand, very obviously reading the badge pinned to my lapel, I found myself wanting to shake him out of the little dream he was in.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>只见他站在那里，手里拿着钢笔，显然非常专注地端详着别在我衣领上的徽章，似乎在做梦，我不禁有一种将他从梦中唤醒的冲动。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Of course, I noticed the name the moment he handed over the paying-in slip. Arthur McKechnie. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>当然，在他轻轻地递过支票时，我注意到了他的名字：阿瑟麦凯尔彻妮。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Everybody knew the McKechnies, and most people knew they were a bad lot. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>大家都知道麦凯尔彻妮兄弟，大多数人都知道他们坏蛋。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>I knew them mainly because my sister Marie was going out with the worst of them. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>我之所以知道他们主要是因为我的姐姐玛丽在和其中最坏一个约会。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>People often told Marie that Stan McKechnie wasn't right for her, which was a mistake, because all that opposition only made her more determined to stick with him. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>经常有人告诉玛丽说斯坦麦凯尔彻妮不适合她，但他们都错了，因为所有的反对意见都适得其反，只是令她更加坚定了要和他交往的决心。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Besides, Stan was good-looking, if you didn't study him too closely. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>如果不仔细看，斯坦长得还算帅气。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Not like this Arthur, who seemed put together from a kit, all angles and mess, with an odd cast to the eyes and a mouth that didn't look altogether finished, like the mouth in a kid's drawing. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>不像这个亚瑟，整个人似乎是由配套元件组合在一起的，满是棱角、邋里邋遢，一双形状古怪的眼睛，略微斜视，那张嘴巴像小孩子在画中画的一样，看上去还没有画成。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>I didn't know then that he was Stan's little brother. Marie had never mentioned an Arthur, though she talked about the McKechnie sisters all the time. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>当时我并不知道他是斯坦的弟弟，玛丽经常会谈起麦凯尔彻妮姐妹们，却从没说起有这么个亚瑟。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>We all did. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>我们都常会谈起麦凯尔彻妮姐妹们。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Some people thought the McKechnie girls were even worse than their brother, if only because they were nice-looking and dressed smart and, if you didn't know them from old, you didn't see what they were capable of until it was too late. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>有人认为她们甚至比她们的弟弟还要糟糕，就算是她们脸蛋漂亮，穿着时髦，如果你认识她们时间不长，根本没法及时看出她们能做出什么事情来。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>With Stan, you knew what he was at first sight; it didn't matter how well he scrubbed up. There was a meanness in his face that you couldn't miss, unless you were Marie and wanted to miss it.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>至于斯坦，不管他怎样精心打扮、衣冠楚楚，你第一眼见到他，也不难看出他脸上的卑劣相，除非你是玛丽，有意视而不见。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>"Arthur handed over the money and the paying-in slip; then, when I had processed the transaction, he took the confirmation chit and, carefully, making no attempt to hide what he was doing, wrote down on the back what it said on my lapel badge. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>亚瑟把钱和存款单递了过来，我为他办理好手续之后处理的事务，他接过确认单，丝毫也不加掩饰他在做什么，仔细地在背面写下我领章上面的内容。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>He was a slow writer. He held his pen in an awkward way, between the first two fingers of his left hand, and he angled his arm round to make the letters, printing them out large: "FIONA, TRAINEE." He didn't seem to care that I could see what he was doing. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>他写字很慢，握笔的姿势笨拙不雅，用左手的拇指和食指捏住钢笔，手臂弯曲，用大写字母一个字母一个字母地写着：”菲奥娜，见习生"，我可以看到他在做什么，可他似乎并不在乎。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>When he was done, he looked up and nodded.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>写罢，他抬起头来，冲我点点头。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>"Is there anything else I can help you with today?" </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>“现在还有什么我可以为您帮忙的吗？</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>I asked, not sure whether I was amused or annoyed.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>我问，不知道是觉得好笑还是恼怒。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>He shook his head. His voice, when he talked, was soft. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>他摇了摇头，轻声说道。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>"Not today, thanks," he said, with an odd, even suggestive emphasis on "today." </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>“现在没有了，谢谢，”他说话时，特别把重音放到"现在"一词上，有几分古怪又像是想暗示什么。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>He smiled then; it was a tight, secretive kind of smile, but it wasn't mean, and I could see that he didn't think there was anything out of the ordinary in what he had just done. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>他笑了笑，那笑容很勉强，又很神秘，但并无恶意，我发现，他对刚才的行为并不觉得有什么不正常。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>He wasn't being smart, or impolite. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>他并没有出言不逊，或失礼。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>He'd just written my name on the back of his confirmation slip, the way a child would, for reasons of his own that had nothing to do with anybody else.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>他刚才不过把我的名字写在他的确认单背面，那样子就像一个孩子，他那样做有他自己的道理，与旁人无关。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>I wanted to say something, but I couldn't find the right words. I just shook my head ever so slightly and looked out to the line for the next customer-and Arthur McKechnie turned to go, that inward little smile on his face, a smile that I could see even then was the sign not only of a secret happiness but also of his inevitable fall. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>我想说点什么，但又不知道说什么好，微微摇摇头，望着排队等候的下一个客户。阿瑟麦凯尔彻妮转身要走时，脸上还挂着一丝浅浅的微笑，那笑容是发自内心的，我察觉到那笑容既流露出某种不为人知的愉悦，又有几分无奈的沮丧。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>I'm not saying I knew what that fall would be, or claiming that I had some kind of premonition; God knows human beings are made for falling, and most human beings in that town were going to fall sooner rather than later. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>我并不是说我知道他因什么而沮丧，也不敢断言我有某种预感；只有上帝知道人类必会沮丧，在那个城镇里大多数人迟早将会沮丧。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>But I did see something out of the ordinary, and I'm sorry now that I didn't take more notice.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>但我的确实看到了某种不寻常的东西，但是我当时没太注意，现在（想起来）还感到有些遗憾。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>I asked Marie about Arthur when I got home that night. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>晚上我回家后，向玛丽打听有关阿瑟的事情。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>She was preoccupied, getting ready to go out with Stan, so I thought she'd just shrug it off, but she stopped putting on her makeup and sat looking at my reflection in the mirror, her eyeliner suspended in midair.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>她忙着化妆，准备去和斯坦约会，所以我以为她会耸耸肩，对我的问题不屑理睬，但她停了下来，坐在那里，望着镜子里我的映像，手中的眼线膏悬在半空中。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>"Arthur?" she said. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>“亚瑟？”她说。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>"Where did you come across him, for God's sake?"</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>“看在上帝的份上，你在哪里遇到他的？”</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>"He came into the bank today," I said.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">

</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>"Oh, yeah?" </seg>

<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>“哦，是吗？”</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Her hand dropped and she grimaced. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>她放下手，厌恶地皱起眉头。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>"Well, don't be getting interested in him. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">

</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>"So who is he, then?" </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>“他究竟是什么人呢？”</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>I said, picking up some clothes that were scattered around the place. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">

<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>I folded her powder-blue sweater and put it away in the chest of drawers. </seg>

</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>“为什么会这样？”</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>"Something to do with money," she said. She watched as I gathered up a pile of obvious laundry. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>“是因为钱的缘故，”她说道，看着我收拢起一大堆该洗的衣服。</seg>
