<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>It was still quite light out of doors, but inside with the curtains drawn and the smouldering fire sending out a dim, uncertain glow, the room was full of deep shadows.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>屋外的天色还很亮，但是里面拉上了窗帘，焖烧的火发出一线暗淡、飘忽不定的光，屋子里全是深暗的阴影。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Brantain sat in one of these shadows; it had overtaken him and he did not mind. </seg>

<seg>布兰泰恩坐在其中一处阴影里，阴影把他全部笼罩了，而他却毫不在意。</seg>

<seg>The obscurity lent him courage to keep his eyes fastened as ardently as he liked upon the girl who sat in the firelight.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>阴暗给了他勇气，使他随心所欲地将目光热烈地锁定在坐在火光中的女孩身上。</seg>

<seg>She was very handsome, with a certain fine, rich coloring that belongs to the healthy brune type. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>她长得很漂亮，肤色精致润泽，属于健康的深色肤型。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>She was quite composed, as she idly stroked the satiny coat of the cat that lay curled in her lap, and she occasionally sent a slow glance into the shadow where her companion sat. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>她非常沉静，悠闲地抚摸着蜷曲在她膝上的小猫光滑的皮毛，偶而缓缓地向她同伴所坐的那处阴影瞥上一眼。</seg>

<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>They were talking low, of indifferent things which plainly were not the things that occupied their thoughts. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>他们在低声谈些无关紧要的小事，那些事显然并不是他们的心思所在。</seg>
</tuv>

<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>She knew that he loved her- a frank, blustering fellow without guile enough to conceal his feelings, and no desire to do so. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>她知道他爱她——一个率直的、大大咧咧的人没有足够的诡计来隐藏他的感情，他也无意这么做。</seg>

<seg>For two weeks past he had sought her society eagerly and persistently. </seg>

<seg>The rather insignificant and unattractive Brantain was enormously rich; and she liked and required the entourage which wealth could give her.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>这个相当不起眼的、毫无魅力的布兰泰恩非常富有；而她喜欢并且也需要财富能够带给她的生活环境。</seg>
</tuv>

<seg>During one of the pauses between their talk of the last tea and the next reception the door opened and a young man entered whom Brantain knew quite well. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>他们谈论着上次的茶会和下次的招待会，在谈话中间的沉默间隙里门开了，一个年轻人进来了，这个人布兰泰恩很熟识。</seg>

<seg>女孩脸转向他。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>A stride or two brought him to her side, and bending over her chair- before she could suspect his intention, for she did not realize that he had not seen her visitor- he pressed an ardent, lingering kiss upon her lips.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>他一两步就走到了她身边，俯身在她椅子上方——在她还没来得及觉察他的意图之前，因为她没想到他没有看到她的访客——他将一个热烈、长久的吻印在她唇上。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>Brantain slowly arose; so did the girl arise, but quickly, and the newcomer stood between them, a little amusement and some defiance struggling with the confusion in his face.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>布兰泰恩慢慢地站起来；女孩也站起来了，动作却是很快的，而那个新来的人站在他们中间，少许玩乐和一些挑衅与他脸上的困惑艰难地交织着。</seg>

<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>"I believe," stammered Brantain, "I see that I have stayed too long. </seg>

<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>“我想，”布兰泰恩结结巴巴地说，“看来我待的时间太长了。</seg>

<seg>He was clutching his hat with both hands, and probably did not perceive that she was extending her hand to him, her presence of mind had not completely deserted her; but she could not have trusted herself to speak.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>他两只手抓着帽子，大概没察觉到她对他伸出了手，她还没完全失去理智；但她相信自己已说不出话了。</seg>

<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>哎，怎么了？”</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>"Don't touch me; don't come near me," she returned angrily. "What do you mean by entering the house without ringing?"</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>“别碰我；别走近我，”她愤怒地回答道，“你不按门铃就进到房里想要干什么？”</seg>

<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>"I came in with your brother, as I often do," he answered coldly, in self-justification. "We came in the side way. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>“我和你哥哥一起进来的，和平常一样，”他冷冷地答道，为自己辩白，“我们从小路进来的。</seg>

<seg>这件不幸的事是不可避免的，这解释够简单，应该能让你满意。</seg>
</tuv>

<seg>But do say that you forgive me, Nathalie," he entreated, softening.</seg>

<seg>At that next reception which she and Brantain had been talking about she approached the young man with a delicious frankness of manner when she saw him there.</seg>

<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>在她和布兰泰恩所谈论的那个下一次的招待会上，当她看到他在那里时，她以一种十分坦率的样子向这个年轻人走过来。</seg>

<seg>“可以跟您说几句话吗，布兰泰恩先生？”她面带迷人而不安的微笑问道。</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>He seemed extremely unhappy; but when she took his arm and walked away with him, seeking a retired corner, a ray of hope mingled with the almost comical misery of his expression. </seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>他看起来极为不快乐；但是当她挽起他的胳膊，和他一起走开寻找一处偏僻的角落时，一线希望混合进他脸上几乎很好笑的痛苦神情里。</seg>

<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>She was apparently very outspoken.</seg>

<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="EN-US">
<seg>When I thought how you might have misinterpreted it, and believed things"- hope was plainly gaining the ascendancy over misery in Brantain's round, guileless face- </seg>

<tuv xml:lang="ZH-CN">
<seg>哦，我知道告诉你这些很荒谬、很没道理；甚至很不庄重，”她差不多在哭泣了，“但是你对——对我怎么想对我来说有很大的区别。”</seg>
